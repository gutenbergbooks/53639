<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p class="noindent">A few months ago the sensational announcement was
made that Professor Haeckel had abandoned Darwinism
and given public support to the teaching of a Jesuit
writer. There was something piquant in the suggestion
that the "Darwin of Germany" had recanted the conclusions
of fifty years of laborious study. Nor could
people forget that only two years before Haeckel had
written with some feeling about the partial recantation of
some of his colleagues. Many of our journals boldly
declined to insert the romantic news, which came
through one of the chief international press agencies.
Others drew the attention of their readers, in jubilant
editorial notes, to the lively prospect it opened out.
To the many inquiries addressed to me as the
"apostle of Professor Haeckel," as Sir Oliver Lodge
dubs me in a genial letter, I timidly represented that
even a German reporter sometimes drank. But the
correction quickly came that the telegram had exactly
reversed the position taken up by the great biologist.
It is only just to the honourable calling of the reporter
to add that, according to the theory current in
Germany, the message was tampered with by subtle
and ubiquitous Jesuistry. Did they not penetrate even
into the culinary service at Hatfield?</p>

<p>I have pleasure in now introducing the three famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lectures delivered by Professor Haeckel at Berlin, and
the reader will see the grotesqueness of the original
announcement. They are the last public deliverance
that the aged professor will ever make. His enfeebled
health forbids us to hope that his decision may yet be
undone. He is now condemned, he tells me, to remain
a passive spectator of the tense drama in which he has
played so prominent a part for half a century. For him
the red rays fall level on the scene and the people about
him. It may be that they light up too luridly, too
falsely, the situation in Germany; but the reader will
understand how a Liberal of Haeckel's temper must
feel his country to be between Scylla and Charybdis&mdash;between
an increasingly clear alternative of Catholicism
or Socialism&mdash;with a helmsman at the wheel whose
vagaries inspire no confidence.</p>

<p>The English reader will care to be instructed on the
antithesis of Virchow and Haeckel which gives point to
these lectures, and which is often misrepresented in this
country. Virchow, the greatest pathologist and one of
the leading anthropologists of Germany, had much to do
with the inspiring of Haeckel's Monistic views in the
fifties. Like several other prominent German thinkers,
Virchow subsequently abandoned the positive Monistic
position for one of agnosticism and scepticism, and a
long and bitter conflict ensued. It is hardly too much
to say that Virchow's ultra-timid reserve in regard to
the evolution of man and other questions has died with
him. Apart from one or two less prominent anthropologists,
and the curious distinction drawn by Dr. A. R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Wallace, science has accepted the fact of evolution, and
has, indeed, accepted the main lines of Haeckel's ancestral
tree of the human race.</p>

<p>In any case, Haeckel had the splendid revenge of
surviving his old teacher and almost lifelong opponent.
Berlin had for years been dominated by the sceptical
temper of Virchow and Du Bois-Reymond. The ardent
evolutionist and opponent of Catholicism was impatient
of a reserve that he felt to be an anachronism in science
and an effective support of reactionary ideas. It was,
therefore, with a peculiar satisfaction that he received the
invitation, after Virchow's death, to address the Berlin
public. Among the many and distinguished honours
that have been heaped upon him in the last ten years
this was felt by him to hold a high place. He could at
last submit freely, in the capital of his country, the
massive foundations and the imposing structure of a
doctrine which he holds to be no less established in
science than valuable in the general cause of progress.</p>

<p>The lectures are reproduced here not solely because
of the interest aroused in them by the "Jesuit" telegram.
They contain a very valuable summary of his conclusions,
and include the latest scientific confirmation. Rarely has
the great biologist written in such clear and untechnical
phrases, so that the general reader will easily learn the
outlines of his much-discussed Monism. To closer
students, who are at times impatient of the Lamarckian
phraseology of Haeckel&mdash;to all, in fact, who would like
to see how the same evolutionary truths are expressed
without reliance on the inheritance of acquired characters&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
may take the opportunity to say that I have translated,
for the same publishers, Professor Guenther's
"Darwinism and the Problems of Life," which will
shortly be in their hands.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="noindent">In the beginning of April, 1905, I received from Berlin
a very unexpected invitation to deliver a popular
scientific lecture at the Academy of Music in that city.
I at first declined this flattering invitation, with thanks,
sending them a copy of a printed declaration, dated 17th
July, 1901, which I had made frequent use of, to the
effect that "I could not deliver any more public lectures,
on account of the state of my health, my advanced age,
and the many labours that were still incumbent on me."</p>

<p>I was persuaded to make one departure from this
fixed resolution, firstly, by the pressing entreaties of many
intimate friends at Berlin. They represented to me how
important it was to give an account myself to the
educated Berlin public of the chief evolutionary conclusions
I had advocated for forty years. They pointed
out emphatically that the increasing reaction in higher
circles, the growing audacity of intolerant orthodoxy, the
preponderance of Ultramontanism, and the dangers that
this involved for freedom of thought in Germany, for
the university and the school, made it imperative to
take vigorous action. It happened that I had just been
following the interesting efforts that the Church has
lately made to enter into a peaceful compromise with
its deadly enemy, Monistic science. It has decided to
accept to a certain extent, and to accommodate to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
creed (in a distorted and mutilated form) the doctrine of
evolution, which it has vehemently opposed for thirty
years. This remarkable change of front on the part of
the Church militant seemed to me so interesting and
important, and at the same time so misleading and
mischievous, that I chose it as the subject of a popular
lecture, and accepted the invitation to Berlin.</p>

<p>After a few days, when I had written my discourse,
I was advised from Berlin that the applications for
admission were so numerous that the lecture must
either be repeated or divided into two. I chose the
latter course, as the material was very abundant. In
compliance with an urgent request, I repeated the two
lectures (17th and 18th April); and as demands for fresh
lectures continued to reach me, I was persuaded to add
a "farewell lecture" (on 19th April), in which I dealt
with a number of important questions that had not been
adequately treated.</p>

<p>The noble gift of effective oratory has been denied
me by Nature. Though I have taught for eighty-eight
terms at the little University of Jena, I have never been
able to overcome a certain nervousness about appearing
in public, and have never acquired the art of expressing
my thoughts in burning language and with appropriate
gesture. For these and other reasons, I have rarely
consented to take part in scientific and other congresses;
the few speeches that I have delivered on such occasions,
and are issued in collected form, were drawn from me
by my deep interest in the great struggle for the triumph
of truth. However, in the three Berlin lectures&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<em>last</em> public addresses&mdash;I had no design of winning my
hearers to my opinions by means of oratory. It was
rather my intention to put before them, in connected
form, the great groups of biological facts, by which they
could, on impartial consideration, convince themselves of
the truth and importance of the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>Readers who are interested in the evolution-controversy,
as I here describe it, will find in my earlier works (<cite>The
History of Creation</cite>, <cite>The Evolution of Man</cite>, <cite>The Riddle of
the Universe</cite>, and <cite>The Wonders of Life</cite>) a thorough treatment
of the views I have summarily presented. I do not
belong to the amiable group of "men of compromise,"
but am in the habit of giving candid and straightforward
expression to the convictions which a half-century of
serious and laborious study has led me to form. If I
seem to be a tactless and inconsiderate "fighter," I pray
you to remember that "conflict is the father of all
things," and that the victory of pure reason over
current superstition will not be achieved without a
tremendous struggle. But I regard <em>ideas</em> only in my
struggles: to the <em>persons</em> of my opponents I am
indifferent, bitterly as they have attacked and slandered
my own person.</p>

<p>Although I have lived in Berlin for many years as
student and teacher, and have always been in communication
with scientific circles there, I have only once
before delivered a public lecture in that city. That
was on "The Division of Labour in Nature and Human
Life" (17th December, 1868). I was, therefore, somewhat
gratified to be able to speak there again (and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the last time), after thirty-six years, especially as it was
in the very spot, the hall of the Academy of Music, in
which I had heard the leaders of the Berlin University
speak fifty years ago.</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I express my cordial
thanks to those who invited me to deliver these lectures,
and who did so much to make my stay in the capital
pleasant; and also to my many hearers for their amiable
and sympathetic attention.</p>

<p class="noindent">The genetic relationship of all vertebrates, from the earliest acrania
and fishes up to the apes and man, is proved in its main lines by
the concordant testimony of paleontology, comparative anatomy, and
embryology. All competent and impartial zoologists now agree that
the vertebrates are all descended from a <em>single</em> stem, and that the root
of this is to be sought in extinct pre-Silurian <i>Acrania</i> (1), somewhat
similar to the living lancelet. The <i>Cyclostoma</i> (2) represent the
transition from the latter to the <em>Fishes</em> (3); and the <em>Dipneusts</em> (4) the
transition from these to the <i>Amphibia</i> (5). From the latter have been
developed the <em>Reptiles</em> (6) on the one hand, and the <em>Mammals</em> (7) on
the other. The most important branch of this most advanced class is
the <em>Primates</em> (8); from the half-apes, or lemurs, a direct line leads,
through the baboons, to the anthropoid apes, and through these on to
man. (<em>Cf.</em> the tables on <a href="#Page_115">pp. 115-120</a>). Further information will be

<p class="p1 noindent">The controversy over the idea of evolution is a
prominent feature in the mental life of the nineteenth
century. It is true that a few great thinkers had
spoken of a natural evolution of all things several
thousand years ago. They had, indeed, partly investigated
the laws that control the birth and death of
the world, and the rise of the earth and its
inhabitants; even the creation-stories and the myths
of the older religions betray a partial influence of
these evolutionary ideas. But it was not until the
nineteenth century that the idea of evolution took
definite shape and was scientifically grounded on
various classes of evidence; and it was not until the
last third of the century that it won general recognition.
The intimate connection that was proved to
exist between all branches of knowledge, once the
continuity of historical development was realised, and
the union of them all through the Monistic philosophy,
are achievements of the last few decades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The great majority of the older ideas that thoughtful
men had formed on the origin and nature of the
world and their own frame were far removed from
the notion of "self-development." They culminated
in more or less obscure creation-myths, which generally
put in the foreground the idea of a personal
Creator. Just as man has used intelligence and
design in the making of his weapons and tools, his
houses and his boats, so it was thought that the
Creator had fashioned the world with art and intelligence,
according to a definite plan. Among the many
legends of this kind the ancient Semitic story of
creation, familiar to us as the Mosaic narrative, but
drawn for the most part from Babylonian sources, has
obtained a very great influence on European culture
owing to the general acceptance of the Bible. The
belief in miracles, that is involved in these religious
legends, was bound to come in conflict, at an early
date, with the evolutionary ideas of independent
philosophical research. On the one hand, in the
prevalent religious teaching, we had the supernatural
world, the miraculous, teleology: on the other hand,
in the nascent science of evolution, only natural law,
pure reason, mechanical causality. Every step that
was made by this science brought into greater relief
its inconsistency with the predominant religion.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>If we glance for a moment at the various fields in
which the idea of evolution is scientifically applied we
find that, firstly, the whole universe is conceived as
a unity; secondly, our earth; thirdly, organic life on
the earth; fourthly, man, as its highest product; and
fifthly, the soul, as a special immaterial entity. Thus
we have, in historical succession, the evolutionary
research of cosmology, geology, biology, anthropology,
and psychology.</p>

<p>The first comprehensive idea of cosmological evolution
was put forth by the famous critical philosopher
Immanuel Kant, in 1755, in the great work of his
earlier years, <cite>General Natural History of the Heavens,
or an Attempt to Conceive and to Explain the Origin
of the Universe mechanically, according to the Newtonian
Laws</cite>. This remarkable work appeared anonymously,
and was dedicated to Frederick the Great, who, however,
never saw it. It was little noticed, and was soon
entirely forgotten, until it was exhumed ninety years
afterwards by Alexander von Humboldt. Note particularly
that on the title-page stress is laid on the
<em>mechanical</em> origin of the world and its explanation on
Newtonian principles; in this way the strictly Monistic
character of the whole cosmogony and the absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
universal rule of natural law are clearly expressed. It
is true that Kant speaks much in it of God and his
wisdom and omnipotence; but this is limited to the
affirmation that God created once for all the unchangeable
laws of nature, and was henceforward bound by
them and only able to work through them. The
Dualism which became so pronounced subsequently in
the philosopher of Koenigsberg counts for very little
here.</p>

<p>The idea of a natural development of the world
occurs in a clearer and more consistent form, and is
provided with a firm mathematical basis, forty years
afterwards, in the remarkable <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mécanique Céleste</cite> of
Pierre Laplace. His popular <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exposition du Système
du Monde</cite> (1796) destroyed at its roots the legend
of creation that had hitherto prevailed, or the
Mosaic narrative in the Bible. Laplace, who had
become Minister of the Interior, Count, and
Chancellor of the Senate, under Napoleon, was
merely honourable and consistent when he replied to
the emperor's question, "What room there was for
God in his system?": "Sire, I had no need for
that unfounded hypothesis." What strange ministers
there are sometimes!<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The shrewdness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Church soon recognised that the personal Creator
was dethroned, and the creation-myth destroyed, by
this Monistic and now generally received theory of
cosmic development. Nevertheless it maintained
towards it the attitude which it had taken up 250
years earlier in regard to the closely related and
irrefutable system of Copernicus. It endeavoured to
conceal the truth as long as possible, or to oppose it
with Jesuitical methods, and finally it yielded. If
the Churches now silently admit the Copernican
system and the cosmogony of Laplace and have
ceased to oppose them, we must attribute the fact,
partly to a feeling of their spiritual impotence, partly
to an astute calculation that the ignorant masses do
not reflect on these great problems.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a clear idea and a firm conviction
of this cosmic evolution by natural law, the
eternal birth and death of millions of suns and stars,
one needs some mathematical training and a lively
imagination, as well as a certain competence in
astronomy and physics. The evolutionary process is
much simpler, and more readily grasped in geology.
Every shower of rain or wave of the sea, every
volcanic eruption and every pebble, gives us a direct
proof of the changes that are constantly taking place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
on the surface of our planet. However, the historical
significance of these changes was not properly
appreciated until 1822, by Karl von Hoff of Gotha,
and modern geology was only founded in 1830 by
Charles Lyell, who explained the whole origin and
composition of the solid crust of the earth, the
formation of the mountains, and the periods of the
earth's development, in a connected system by natural
laws. From the immense thickness of the stratified
rocks, which contain the fossilised remains of extinct
organisms, we discovered the enormous length&mdash;running
into millions of years&mdash;of the periods during
which these sedimentary rocks were deposited in
water. Even the duration of the <em>organic</em> history of
the earth&mdash;that is to say, the period during which the
plant and animal population of our planet was
developing&mdash;must itself be put at more than a
hundred million years. These results of geology
and paleontology destroyed the current legend of
the six days' work of a personal Creator. Many
attempts were made, it is true, and are still being
made, to reconcile the Mosaic supernatural story of
creation with modern geology.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> All these efforts of
believers are in vain. We may say, in fact, that it
is precisely the study of geology, the reflection it
entails on the enormous periods of evolution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the habit of seeking the simple mechanical causes of
their constant changes, that contribute very considerably
to the advance of enlightenment. Yet in spite
of this (or, possibly, because of this), geological
instruction is either greatly neglected or entirely
suppressed in most schools. It is certainly eminently
calculated (in connection with geography) to enlarge
the mind, and acquaint the child with the idea of
evolution. An educated person who knows the
elements of geology will never experience <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>. He
will find everywhere in surrounding nature, in the
rocks and in the water, in the desert and on the
mountains, the most instructive stimuli to reflection.</p>

<p>The evolutionary process in organic nature is much
more difficult to grasp. Here we must distinguish two
different series of biological development, which have
only been brought into proper causal connection by
means of our biogenetic law (1866); one series is
found in embryology (or ontogeny), the other in
phylogeny (or race-development). In Germany
"evolution" always meant embryology, or a part of
the whole, until forty years ago. It stood for a
microscopic examination of the wonderful processes by
means of which the elaborate structure of the plant or
animal body is formed from the simple seed of the plant
or the egg of the bird. Until the beginning of the
nineteenth century the erroneous view was generally
received that this marvellously complicated structure
existed, completely formed, in the simple ovum, and
that the various organs had merely to grow and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
shape themselves independently by a process of
"evolution" (or unfolding), before they entered into
activity. An able German scientist, Caspar Friedrich
Wolff (son of a Berlin tailor), had already shown the
error of this "pre-formation theory" in 1759. He
had proved, in his dissertation for the doctorate, that no
trace of the later body, of its bones, muscles, nerves,
and feathers, can be found in the hen's egg (the
commonest and most convenient object for study), but
merely a small round disk, consisting of two thin
superimposed layers. He had further showed that
the various organs are only built up gradually out
of these simple elements, and that we can trace, step
by step, a series of real new growths. However,
these momentous discoveries, and the sound "theory
of epigenesis" that he based on them, were wholly
ignored for fifty years, and even rejected by the leading
authorities. It was not until Oken had re-discovered
these important facts at Jena (1806), Pander had more
carefully distinguished the germinal layers (1817), and
finally Carl Ernst von Baer had happily combined
observation and reflection in his classical <cite>Animal
Embryology</cite> (1828), that embryology attained the rank
of an independent science with a sound empirical base.</p>

<p>A little later it secured a well-merited recognition
in botany also, especially owing to the efforts of
Matthias Schleiden of Jena, the distinguished student
who provided biology with a new foundation in the
"cell theory" (1838). But it was not until the middle of
the nineteenth century that people generally recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that the ovum of the plant or animal is itself only
a simple cell, and that the later tissues and organs
gradually develop from this "elementary organism" by
a repeated cleavage of, and division of labour in, the
cells. The most important step was then made of
recognising that our human organism also develops
from an ovum (first discovered by Baer in 1827), in
virtue of the same laws, and that its embryonic development
resembles that of the other mammals, especially
that of the ape. Each of us was, at the beginning of
his existence, a simple globule of protoplasm, surrounded
by a membrane, about<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">120</span>
</span>
of an inch in
diameter, with a firmer nucleus inside it. These important
embryological discoveries confirmed the rational
conception of the human organism that had been
attained much earlier by comparative anatomy: the
conviction that the human frame is built in the same
way, and develops similarly from a simple ovum, as the
body of all other mammals. Even Linné had already
(1735) given man a place in the mammal class in his
famous <cite>System of Nature</cite>.</p>

<p>Differently from these embryological facts, which
can be directly observed, the phenomena of phylogeny
(the development of species), which are needed to set
the former in their true light, are usually outside the
range of immediate observation. What was the origin
of the countless species of animals and plants? How
can we explain the remarkable relationships which unite
similar species into genera and these into classes?
Linné answers the question very simply with the belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in creation, relying on the generally accepted Mosaic
narrative: "There are as many different species of
animals and plants as there were different forms created
by God in the beginning." The first scientific answer
was given in 1809 by the great French scientist,
Lamarck. He taught, in his suggestive <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Philosophie
Zoologique</cite>, that the resemblances in form and structure
of groups of species are due to real affinity, and that
all organisms descend from a few very simple primitive
forms (or, possibly, from a single one). These primitive
forms were developed out of lifeless matter by spontaneous
generation. The resemblances of related groups
of species are explained by <em>inheritance</em> from common
stem-forms; their dissimilarities are due to <em>adaptation</em>
to different environments, and to variety in the action
of the modifiable organs. The human race has arisen
in the same way, by transformation of a series of mammal
ancestors, the nearest of which are ape-like primates.</p>

<p>These great ideas of Lamarck, which threw light
on the whole field of organic life, and were closely
approached by Goethe in his own speculations, gave
rise to the theory that we now know as transformism,
or the theory of evolution or descent. But the far-seeing
Lamarck was&mdash;as Caspar Friedrich Wolff had been
fifty years before&mdash;half a century before his time. His
theory obtained no recognition, and was soon wholly
forgotten.</p>

<p>It was brought into the light once more in 1859 by
the genius of Charles Darwin, who had been born in
the very year that the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Philosophie Zoologique</cite> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
published. The substance and the success of his
system, which has gone by the name of Darwinism
(in the wider sense) for forty-six years, are so generally
known that I need not dwell on them. I will only point
out that the great success of Darwin's epoch-making
works is due to two causes: firstly, to the fact that the
English scientist most ingeniously worked up the
empirical material that had accumulated during fifty years
into a systematic proof of the theory of descent; and
secondly, to the fact that he gave it the support of a second
theory of his own, the theory of natural selection. This
theory, which gives a causal explanation of the transformation
of species, is what we ought to call "Darwinism"
in the strict sense. We cannot go here into the question
how far this theory is justified, or how far it is corrected
by more recent theories, such as Weismann's theory of
germ-plasm (1844), or De Vries's theory of mutations
(1900). Our concern is rather with the unparalleled
influence that Darwinism, and its application to man,
have had during the last forty years on the whole province
of science; and at the same time, with its irreconcilable
opposition to the dogmas of the Churches.</p>

<p>The extension of the theory of evolution to man was,
naturally, one of the most interesting and momentous
applications of it. If all other organisms arose, not by
a miraculous creation, but by a natural modification of
earlier forms of life, the presumption is that the human
race also was developed by the transformation of the
most man-like mammals, the primates of Linné&mdash;the apes
and lemurs. This natural inference, which Lamarck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
had drawn in his simple way, but Darwin had at first
explicitly avoided, was first thoroughly established by
the gifted zoologist, Thomas Huxley, in his three
lectures on <cite>Man's Place in Nature</cite> (1863). He showed
that this "question of questions" is unequivocally
answered by three chief witnesses&mdash;the natural history
of the anthropoid apes, the anatomic and embryological
relations of man to the animals immediately below him,
and the recently discovered fossil human remains.
Darwin entirely accepted these conclusions of his friend
eight years afterwards, and, in his two-volume work,
<cite>The Descent of Man and Sexual Selection</cite> (1871),
furnished a number of new proofs in support of the
dreaded "descent of man from the ape." I myself then
(1874) completed the task I had begun in 1866, of
determining approximately the whole series of the
extinct animal ancestors of the human race, on the
ground of comparative anatomy, embryology, and
paleontology. This attempt was improved, as our
knowledge advanced, in the five editions of my
<cite>Evolution of Man</cite>. In the last twenty years a vast
literature on the subject has accumulated. I must
assume that you are acquainted with the contents of
one or other of these works, and will turn to the
question, that especially engages our attention at
present, how the inevitable struggle between these
momentous achievements of modern science and the
dogmas of the Churches has run in recent years.</p>

<p>It was obvious that both the general theory of
evolution and its extension to man in particular must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
meet from the first with the most determined resistance
on the part of the Churches. Both were in flagrant
contradiction to the Mosaic story of creation, and other
Biblical dogmas that were involved in it, and are still
taught in our elementary schools. It is creditable to
the shrewdness of the theologians and their associates,
the metaphysicians, that they at once rejected
Darwinism, and made a particularly energetic resistance
in their writings to its chief consequence, the descent
of man from the ape. This resistance seemed the more
justified and hopeful as, for seven or eight years after
Darwin's appearance, few biologists accepted his theory,
and the general attitude amongst them was one of cold
scepticism. I can well testify to this from my own
experience. When I first openly advocated Darwin's
theory at a scientific congress at Stettin in 1863, I was
almost alone, and was blamed by the great majority for
taking up seriously so fantastic a theory, "the dream
of an after-dinner nap," as the Göttinger zoologist,
Keferstein, called it.</p>

<p>The general attitude towards Nature fifty years ago
was so different from that we find everywhere to-day,
that it is difficult to convey a clear idea of it to a young
scientist or philosopher. The great question of creation,
the problem how the various species of plants and
animals came into the world, and how man came into
being, did not exist yet in exact science. There was,
in fact, no question of it.</p>

<p>Seventy-seven years ago Alexander von Humboldt
delivered, in this very spot, the lectures which afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
made up his famous work, <cite>Cosmos, the Elements of a
Physical Description of the World</cite>. As he touched, in
passing, the obscure problem of the origin of the organic
population of our planet, he could only say resignedly:
"The mysterious and unsolved problem of how things
came to be does not belong to the empirical province
of objective research, the description of what <em>is</em>." It is
instructive to find Johannes Müller, the greatest of
German biologists in the nineteenth century, speaking
thus in 1852, in his famous essay, "On the Generation
of Snails in Holothurians": "The entrance of various
species of animals into creation is certain&mdash;it is a fact of
paleontology; but it is <em>supernatural</em> as long as this
entrance cannot be perceived in the act and become an
element of observation." I myself had a number of
remarkable conversations with Müller, whom I put at
the head of all my distinguished teachers, in the summer
of 1854. His lectures on comparative anatomy and
physiology&mdash;the most illuminating and stimulating I
ever heard&mdash;had captivated me to such an extent that
I asked and obtained his permission to make a closer
study of the skeletons and other preparations in his
splendid museum of comparative anatomy (then in the
right wing of the buildings of the Berlin University),
and to draw them. Müller (then in his fifty-fourth year)
used to spend the Sunday afternoon alone in the
museum. He would walk to and fro for hours in the
spacious rooms, his hands behind his back, buried in
thought about the mysterious affinities of the vertebrates,
the "holy enigma" of which was so forcibly impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
by the row of skeletons. Now and again my great
master would turn to a small table at the side, at which
I (a student of twenty years) was sitting in the angle of
a window, making conscientious drawings of the skulls
of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes.</p>

<p>I would then beg him to explain particularly difficult
points in anatomy, and once I ventured to put the
question: "Must not all these vertebrates, with their
identity in internal skeleton, in spite of all their
external differences, have come originally from a
common form?" The great master nodded his head
thoughtfully, and said: "Ah, if we only knew that!
If ever you solve that riddle, you will have
accomplished a supreme work." Two months afterwards,
in September, 1854, I had to accompany Müller
to Heligoland, and learned under his direction the
beautiful and wonderful inhabitants of the sea. As we
fished together in the sea, and caught the lovely
medusæ, I asked him how it was possible to explain
their remarkable alternation of generations; if the
medusæ, from the ova of which polyps develop to-day,
must not have come originally from the more simply
organised polyps? To this precocious question, I
received the same resigned answer: "Ah, that is a
very obscure problem! We know nothing whatever
about the origin of species."</p>

<p>Johannes Müller was certainly one of the greatest
scientists of the nineteenth century. He takes rank
with Cuvier, Baer, Lamarck, and Darwin. His insight
was profound and penetrating, his philosophic judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
comprehensive, and his mastery of the vast province
of biology was enormous. Emil du Bois-Reymond
happily compared him, in his fine commemorative
address, to Alexander the Great, whose kingdom
was divided into several independent realms at his
death. In his lectures and works Müller treated
no less than four different subjects, for which four
separate chairs were founded after his death in 1858&mdash;human
anatomy, physiology, pathological anatomy,
and comparative anatomy. In fact, we ought really
to add two more subjects&mdash;zoology and embryology.
Of these, also, we learned more from Müller's classic
lectures than from the official lectures of the professors
of those subjects. The great master died in 1858, a
few months before Charles Darwin and Alfred R.
Wallace made their first communications on their new
theory of selection in the Journal of the Linnæan
Society. I do not doubt in the least that this surprising
answer of the riddle of creation would have profoundly
moved Müller, and have been fully admitted by him
on mature reflection.</p>

<p>To these leading masters in biology, and to all other
anatomists, physiologists, zoologists, and botanists up
to 1858, the question of organic creation was an
unsolved problem; the great majority regarded it as
insoluble. The theologians and their allies, the metaphysicians,
built triumphantly on this fact. It afforded
a clear proof of the limitations of reason and science.
A miracle only could account for the origin of these
ingenious and carefully designed organisms; nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
less than the Divine wisdom and omnipotence could
have brought man into being. But this general
resignation of reason, and the dominance of supernatural
ideas which it encouraged, were somewhat paradoxical
in the thirty years between Lyell and Darwin, between
1830 and 1859, since the natural evolution of the earth,
as conceived by the great geologist, had come to be
universally recognised. Since the earlier of these
dates the iron necessity of natural law had ruled in
inorganic nature, in the formation of the mountains
and the movement of the heavenly bodies. In organic
nature, on the contrary, in the creation and the life
of animals and plants, people saw only the wisdom
and power of an intelligent Creator and Controller;
in other words, everything was ruled by mechanical
causality in the inorganic world, but by teleological
finality in the realm of biology.</p>

<p>Philosophy, strictly so called, paid little or no
attention to this dilemma. Absorbed almost exclusively
in metaphysical and dialectical speculations,
it looked with supreme contempt or indifference on
the enormous progress that the empirical sciences
were making. It affected, in its character of "purely
mental science," to build up the world out of its own
head, and to have no need of the splendid material
that was being laboriously gathered by observation
and experiment. This is especially true of Germany,
where Hegel's system of "absolute idealism" had
secured the highest regard, particularly since it had
been made obligatory as "the royal State-philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of Prussia"&mdash;mainly because, according to Hegel, "in
the State the Divine will itself and the monarchical
constitution alone represent the development of
reason; all other forms of constitution are lower
stages of the development of reason." Hegel's
abstruse metaphysics has also been greatly appreciated
because it has made so thorough and consistent a
use of the idea of evolution. But this pretended
"evolution of reason" floated far above real nature
in the pure ether of the absolute spirit, and was
devoid of all the material ballast that the empirical
science of the evolution of the world, the earth, and
its living population, had meantime accumulated.
Moreover, it is well known how Hegel himself
declared, with humorous resignation, that only <em>one</em>
of his many pupils had understood him, and this one
had misunderstood him.</p>

<p>From the higher standpoint of general culture the
difficult question forces itself on us: What is the real
value of the idea of evolution in the whole realm of
science? We are bound to answer that it varies
considerably. The facts of the evolution of the
individual, or of ontogeny, were easy to observe and
grasp: the evolution of the crust of the earth and of
the mountains in geology seemed to have an equally
sound empirical foundation; the physical evolution of
the universe seemed to be established by mathematical
speculation. There was no longer any serious
question of <em>creation</em>, in the literal sense, of the
deliberate action of a personal Creator, in these great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
provinces. But this made people cling to the idea
more than ever in regard to the origin of the
countless species of animals and plants, and especially
the creation of man. This transcendental problem
seemed to be entirely beyond the range of natural
development; and the same was thought of the
question of the nature and origin of the soul, the
mystic entity that was appropriated by metaphysical
speculation as its subject. Charles Darwin suddenly
brought a clear light into this dark chaos of contradictory
notions in 1859. His epoch-making work,
<cite>The Origin of Species</cite>, proved convincingly that this
historical process is not a supernatural mystery, but
a physiological phenomenon; and that the preservation
of improved races in the struggle for life had
produced, by a natural evolution, the whole wondrous
world of organic life.</p>

<p>To-day, when evolution is almost universally
recognised in biology, when thousands of anatomic
and physiological works are based on it every year,
the new generation can hardly form an idea of the
violent resistance that was offered to Darwin's theory
and the impassioned struggles it provoked. In the
first place, the Churches at once raised a vigorous
protest; they rightly regarded their new antagonist
as the deadly enemy of the legend of creation, and saw
the very foundations of their creed threatened. The
Churches found a powerful ally in the dualistic
metaphysics that still claims to represent the real
"idealist philosophy" at most universities. But most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dangerous of all to the young theory was the violent
resistance it met almost everywhere in its own province
of empirical science. The prevailing belief in the
fixity and the independent creation of the various
species was much more seriously menaced by Darwin's
theory than it had been by Lamarck's transformism.
Lamarck had said substantially the same thing fifty
years before, but had failed to convince through the
lack of effective evidence. Many scientists, some of
great distinction, opposed Darwin because either they
had not an adequate acquaintance with the whole field
of biology, or it seemed to them that his bold speculation
advanced too far from the secure base of experience.</p>

<p>When Darwin's work appeared in 1859, and fell like
a flash of lightning on the dark world of official biology,
I was engaged in a scientific expedition to Sicily and
taken up with a thorough study of the graceful
radiolarians, those wonderful microscopic marine
animals that surpass all other organisms in the
beauty and variety of their forms. The special study
of this remarkable class of animals, of which I afterwards
described more than 4,000 species, after more
than ten years of research, provided me with one of
the solid foundation-stones of my Darwinian ideas.
But when I returned from Messina to Berlin in the
spring of 1860, I knew nothing as yet of Darwin's
achievement. I merely heard from my friends at
Berlin that a remarkable work by a crazy Englishman
had attracted great attention, and that it turned upside
down all previous ideas as to the origin of species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>I soon perceived that almost all the experts at
Berlin&mdash;chief amongst them were the famous microscopist,
Ehrenberg; the anatomist, Reichert; the
zoologist, Peters; and the geologist, Beyrich&mdash;were
unanimous in their condemnation of Darwin. The
brilliant orator of the Berlin Academy, Emil du Bois-Reymond,
hesitated. He recognised that the theory
of evolution was the only natural solution of the
problem of creation; but he laughed at the application
of it as a poor romance, and declared that the
phylogenetic inquiries into the relationship of the
various species had about as much value as the
research of philologists into the genealogical tree of
the Homeric heroes. The distinguished botanist,
Alexander Braun, stood quite alone in his full and
warm assent to the theory of evolution. I found
comfort and encouragement with this dear and
respected teacher, when I was deeply moved by the
first reading of Darwin's book, and soon completely
converted to his views. In Darwin's great and
harmonious conception of Nature, and his convincing
establishment of evolution, I had an answer to all the
doubts that had beset me since the beginning of my
biological studies.</p>

<p>My famous teacher, Rudolf Virchow, whom I had met
at Würtzburg in 1852, and was soon associated with in
the most friendly relations as special pupil and admiring
assistant, played a very curious part in this great
controversy. I am, I think, one of those elderly men
who have followed Virchow's development, as man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
thinker, with the greatest interest during the last fifty
years. I distinguish three periods in his psychological
metamorphoses. In the first decade of his academic life,
from 1847 to 1858, mainly at Würtzburg, he effected the
great reform of medicine that culminated brilliantly in
his cellular pathology. In the following twenty years
(1858-1877) he was chiefly occupied with politics and
anthropology. He was at first favourable to Darwinism,
then sceptical, and finally rejected it. His powerful and
determined opposition to it dates from 1877, when, in
is famous speech on "The Freedom of Science in the
Modern State," he struck a heavy blow at that freedom,
denounced the theory of evolution as dangerous to the
State, and demanded its exclusion from the schools.
This remarkable metamorphosis is so important, and has
had so much influence, yet has been so erroneously
described, that I will deal with it somewhat fully in the
next chapter, especially as I have then to treat one chief
problem, the descent of man from the ape. For the
moment, I will merely recall the fact that in Berlin, the
"metropolis of intelligence," as it has been called, the
theory of evolution, now generally accepted, met with a
more stubborn resistance than in most of our other
leading educational centres, and that this opposition was
due above all to the powerful authority of Virchow.</p>

<p>We can only glance briefly here at the victorious
struggle that the idea of evolution has conducted in
the last three decades of the nineteenth century. The
violent resistance that Darwinism encountered nearly
everywhere in its early years was paralysed towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
end of the first decade. In the years 1866-1874 many
works were published in which not only were the
foundations of the theory scientifically strengthened, but
its general recognition was secured by popular treatment
of the subject. I made the first attempt in 1866, in my
<cite>General Morphology</cite>, to present connectedly the whole
subject of evolution and make it the foundation of a
consistent Monistic philosophy; and I then gave a
popular summary of my chief conclusions in the ten
editions of my <cite>History of Creation</cite>. In my <cite>Evolution
of Man</cite> I made the first attempt to apply the principles
of evolution thoroughly and consistently to man, and
to draw up a hypothetical list of his animal ancestors.
The three volumes of my <cite>Systematic Phylogeny</cite> (1894-1896)
contain a fuller outline of a natural classification
of organisms on the basis of their stem-history. There
have been important contributions to the science of
evolution in all its branches in the Darwinian periodical,
<cite>Cosmos</cite>, since 1877; and a number of admirable popular
works helped to spread the system.</p>

<p>However, the most important and most welcome
advance was made by science when, in the last thirty
years, the idea of evolution penetrated into every branch
of biology, and was recognised as fundamental and
indispensable. Thousands of new discoveries and
observations in all sections of botany, zoology, protistology,
and anthropology, were brought forward as
empirical evidence of evolution. This is especially
true of the remarkable progress of paleontology, comparative
anatomy, and embryology, but it applies also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to physiology, chorology (the science of the distribution
of living things), and œcology (the description of the
habits of animals). How much our horizon was extended
by these, and how much the unity of our
Monistic system gained, can be seen in any modern
manual of biology. If we compare them with those
that gave us extracts of natural history forty or fifty
years ago, we see at once what an enormous advance
has taken place. Even the more remote branches of
anthropological science, ethnography, sociology, ethics,
and jurisprudence, are entering into closer relations
with the theory of evolution, and can no longer escape
its influence. In view of all this, it is ridiculous for
theological and metaphysical journals to talk, as they
do, of the failure of evolution and "the death-bed of
Darwinism."</p>

<p>Our science of evolution won its greatest triumph
when, at the beginning of the twentieth century, its
most powerful opponents, the Churches, became reconciled
to it, and endeavoured to bring their dogmas into
line with it. A number of timid attempts to do so had
been made in the preceding ten years by different free-thinking
theologians and philosophers, but without much
success. The distinction of accomplishing this in a
comprehensive and well-informed manner was reserved
for a Jesuit, Father Erich Wasmann of Luxemburg.
This able and learned entomologist had already earned
some recognition in zoology by a series of admirable
observations on the life of ants, and the captives that
they always keep in their homes, certain very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
insects which have themselves been curiously modified
by adaptation to their peculiar environment. He
showed that these striking modifications can only
be rationally explained by descent from other free-living
species of insects. The various papers in which
Wasmann gave a thoroughly Darwinian explanation
of the biological phenomena first appeared (1901-1903)
in the Catholic periodical, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stimmen aus Maria-Laach</cite>,
and are now collected in a special work entitled, <cite>Modern
Biology and the Theory of Evolution</cite>.</p>

<p>This remarkable book of Wasmann's is a masterpiece
of Jesuitical sophistry. It really consists of three
entirely different sections. The first third gives, in
the introduction, what is, for Catholics, a clear and
instructive account of modern biology, especially the cell-theory,
and the theory of evolution (chapters i.-viii.).
The second third, the ninth chapter, is the most valuable
part of the work. It has the title: "The Theory of
Fixity or the theory of Evolution?" Here the learned
entomologist gives an interesting account of the results
of his prolonged studies of the morphology and the
œcology of the ants and their captives, the myrmecophilæ.
He shows impartially and convincingly that
these complicated and remarkable phenomena can only
be explained by evolution, and that the older doctrine
of the fixity and independent creation of the various
species is quite untenable. With a few changes this
ninth chapter could figure as a useful part of a work
by Darwin or Weismann or some other evolutionist.
The succeeding chapter (the last third) is flagrantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
inconsistent with the ninth. It deals most absurdly with
the application of the theory of evolution to man. The
reader has to ask himself whether Wasmann really
believes these confused and ridiculous notions, or
whether he merely aims at befogging his readers, and
so preparing the way for the acceptance of the
conventional creed.</p>

<p>Wasmann's book has been well criticised by a number
of competent students, especially by Escherich and
Francé. While fully recognising his great services,
they insist very strongly on the great mischief wrought
by this smuggling of the Jesuitical spirit into biology.
Escherich points out at length the glaring inconsistencies
and the obvious untruths of this "ecclesiastical evolution."
He summarises his criticism in the words: "If the
theory of evolution can really be reconciled with the
dogmas of the Church only in the way we find here,
Wasmann has clearly proved that any such reconciliation
is impossible. Because what Wasmann gives here
as the theory of evolution is a thing mutilated beyond
recognition and incapable of any vitality." He tries,
like a good Jesuit, to prove that it does not tend to
undermine, but to give a firm foundation to, the story
of supernatural creation, and that it was really not
Lamarck and Darwin, but St. Augustin and St. Thomas
of Aquin, who founded the science of evolution. "God
does not interfere directly in the order of Nature when
he can act by means of natural causes." Man alone
constitutes a remarkable exception; because "the
human soul, being a spiritual entity, cannot be derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from matter even by the Divine omnipotence, like the
vital forms of the plants and animals" (p. 299).</p>

<p>In an instructive article on "Jesuitical Science" (in the
Frankfort <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freie Wort</cite>, No. 22, 1904), R. H. Francé
gives an interesting list of the prominent Jesuits who
are now at work in the various branches of science.
As he rightly says, the danger consists "in a systematic
introduction of the Jesuitical spirit into science, a persistent
perversion of all its problems and solutions, and
an astute undermining of its foundations; to speak more
precisely, the danger is that people are not sufficiently
conscious of it, and that they, and even science itself,
fall into the cleverly prepared pit of believing that there
is such a thing as <em>Jesuitical science</em>, the results of which
may be taken seriously."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>While fully recognising these dangers, I nevertheless
feel that the Jesuit Father Wasmann, and his colleagues,
have&mdash;unwittingly&mdash;done a very great service to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
progress of pure science. The Catholic Church, the
most powerful and widespread of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Christain sects'">Christian sects</ins>,
sees itself compelled to capitulate to the idea of evolution.
It embraces the most important application of the idea,
Lamarck and Darwin's theory of descent, which it had
vigorously combated until twenty years ago. It does,
indeed, mutilate the great tree, cutting off its roots and
its highest branch; it rejects spontaneous generation or
archigony at the bottom, and the descent of man from
animal ancestors above. But these exceptions will not
last. Impartial biology will take no notice of them, and
the religious creed will at length determine that the more
complex species have been evolved from a series of
simpler forms according to Darwinian principles. The
belief in a supernatural creation is restricted to the
production of the earliest and simplest stem-forms, from
which the "natural species" have taken their origin;
Wasmann gives that name to all species that are demonstrably
descended from a common stem-form; in other
words, to what other classifiers call "stems" or "phyla."
The 4,000 species of ants in his system, which he believes
to be genetically related, are comprised by him in one
"natural species." On the other hand, man forms one
isolated "natural species" for himself, without any
connection with the other mammals.</p>

<p>The Jesuitical sophistry that Wasmann betrays in
this ingenious distinction between "systematic and
natural species" is also found in his philosophic
"Thoughts on Evolution" (chap. viii.), his distinction
between philosophic and scientific evolution, or between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
evolution in one stem and in several stems. His
remarks (in chap. vii.) on "the cell and spontaneous
generation" are similarly marred by sophistry. The
question of spontaneous generation or archigony&mdash;that is
to say, of the first appearance of organic life on the
earth, is one of the most difficult problems in biology,
one of those in which the most distinguished students
betray a striking weakness of judgment. Dr. Heinrich
Schmidt, of Jena, has lately written an able and popular
little work on that subject. In his <cite>Spontaneous Generation
and Professor Reinke</cite> (1903), he has shown to what
absurd consequences the ecclesiastical ideas lead on this
very question. The botanist Reinke, of Kiel, is now
regarded amongst religious people as the chief opponent
of Darwinism; for many conservatives this is because
he is a member of the Prussian Herrenhaus (a very
intelligent body, of course!). Although he is a strong
evangelical, many of his mystic deductions agree surprisingly
with the Catholic speculations of Father
Wasmann. This is especially the case with regard to
spontaneous generation. They both declare that the
first appearance of life must be traced to a miracle, to
the work of a personal deity, whom Reinke calls the
"cosmic intelligence." I have shown the unscientific
character of these notions in my last two works, <cite>The
Riddle of the Universe</cite>, and <cite>The Wonders of Life</cite>. I
have drawn attention especially to the widely distributed
monera of the chromacea class&mdash;organisms of the
simplest type conceivable, whose whole body is merely
an unnucleated, green, structureless globule of plasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
(Chroococcus); their whole vital activity consists of
growth (by forming plasm) and multiplication (by dividing
into two). There is little theoretical difficulty in
conceiving the origin of these new simple monera from
inorganic compounds of albumen, or their later transformation
into the simplest nucleated cells. All this,
and a good deal more that will not fit in his Jesuitical
frame, is shrewdly ignored by Wasmann.</p>

<p>In view of the great influence that Catholicism still
has on public life in Germany, through the Centre
party, this change of front should be a great gain to
education. Virchow demanded as late as 1877 that
the dangerous doctrine of evolution should be excluded
from the schools. The Ministers of Instruction of
the two chief German States gratefully adopted this
warning from the leader of the progressive party,
forbade the teaching of Darwinian ideas, and made
every effort to check the spread of biological knowledge.
Now, twenty-five years afterwards, the Jesuits
come forward, and demand the opposite. They
recognise openly that the hated theory of evolution
is established, and try to reconcile it with the creed!
What an irony of history! And we find much the
same story when we read the struggles for freedom
of thought and for the recognition of evolution in
the other educated countries of Europe.</p>

<p>In Italy, its cradle and home, educated people
generally look upon the papacy with the most
profound disdain. I have spent many years in Italy,
and have never met an educated Italian of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
bigoted and narrow views as we usually find amongst
educated German Catholics&mdash;represented with success
in the Reichstag by the Centre party. It is proof
enough of the reactionary character of German
Catholics that the Pope himself describes them as
his most vigorous soldiers, and points them out as
models to the faithful of other nations. As the whole
history of the Roman Church shows, the charlatan
of the Vatican is the deadly enemy of free science
and free teaching. The present German Emperor
ought to regard it as his most sacred duty to
maintain the tradition of the Reformation, and to
promote the formation of the German people in the
sense of Frederick the Great. Instead of this we
have to look on with heavy hearts while the Emperor,
badly advised and misled by those in influence about
him, suffers himself to be caught closer and closer
in the net of the Catholic clergy, and sacrifices to it
the intelligence of the rising generation. In September,
1904, the Catholic journals announced triumphantly
that the adoption of Catholicism by the Emperor and
his Chancellor was close at hand.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The firmness of the belief in conventional dogmas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which hampers the progress of rational enlightenment
in orthodox Protestant circles as well as Catholic, is
often admired as an expression of the deep emotion
of the German people. But its real source is their
confusion of thought and their credulity, the power
of conservative tradition, and the reactionary state
of political education. While our schools are bent
under the yoke of the creeds, those of our neighbours
are free. France, the pious daughter of the Church,
gives anxious moments to her ambitious mother. She
is breaking the chains of the Concordat, and taking
up the work of the Reformation. In Germany, the
birthplace of the Reformation, the Reichstag and the
Government vie with each other in smoothing the
paths for the Jesuits, and fostering, instead of
suppressing, the intolerant spirit of the sectarian
school. Let us hope that the latest episode in the
history of evolution, its recognition by Jesuitical
science, will bring about the reverse of what they
intend&mdash;the substitution of rational science for blind
faith.</p>

represent divergent branches of the stem, of which man is the crown.

<p class="p1 noindent">In the previous chapter I tried to give you a general
idea of the present state of the controversy in regard to
evolution. Comparing the various branches of thought
we found that the older mythological ideas of the
creation of the world were driven long ago out of the
province of inorganic science, but that they did not
yield to the rational conception of natural development
until a much later date in the field of organic nature.
Here the idea of evolution did not prove completely
victorious until the beginning of the twentieth century,
when its most zealous and dangerous opponent, the
Church, was forced to admit it. Hence the open
acknowledgment of the Jesuit, Father Wasmann,
deserves careful attention, and we may look forward to
a further development. If his force of conviction and
his moral courage are strong enough, he will go on to
draw the normal conclusions from his high scientific
attainments and leave the Catholic Church, as the
prominent Jesuits, Count Hoensbroech and the able
geologist, Professor Renard of Ghent, one of the workers
on the deep-sea deposits in the <em>Challenger</em> expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
have lately done. But even if this does not happen,
his recognition of Darwinism, in the name of Christian
belief, will remain a landmark in the history of evolution.
His ingenious and very Jesuitical attempt to bring
together the opposite poles will have no very
mischievous effect; it will rather tend to hasten the
victory of the scientific conception of evolution over the
mystic beliefs of the Churches.</p>

<p>You will see this more clearly if we go on to consider
the important special problem of the "descent of man
from the ape," and its irreconcilability with the conventional
belief that God made man according to His
own image. That this ape or pithecoid theory is an
irresistible deduction from the general principle of
evolution was clearly recognised forty-five years ago,
when Darwin's work appeared, by the shrewd and
vigilant theologians; it was precisely in this fact that
they found their strongest motive for vigorous resistance.
It is quite clear. <em>Either</em> man was brought into existence,
like the other animals, by a special creative act,
as Moses and Linné taught (an "embodied idea of the
Creator," as the famous Agassiz put it so late as 1858);
<em>or</em> he has been developed naturally from a series of
mammal ancestors, as is claimed by the systems of
Lamarck and Darwin.</p>

<p>In view of the very great importance of this pithecoid
theory, we will first cast a brief glance at its founders
and then summarise the proofs in support of it. The
famous French biologist, Jean Lamarck, was the first
scientist definitely to affirm the descent of man from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the ape and seek to give scientific proof of it. In his
splendid work, fifty years in advance of his time, the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '1899'">
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Philosophie Zoologique</cite> (1809)</ins>, he clearly traced the
modifications and advances that must have taken place
in the transformation of the man-like apes (the primate
forms similar to the orang <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and the champanzee)'">and the chimpanzee)</ins>; the
adaptation to walking upright, the consequent modification
of the hands and feet, and later, the formation
of speech and the attainment of a higher degree of
intelligence. Lamarck's remarkable theory, and this
important consequence of it, soon fell into oblivion.
When Darwin brought evolution to the front again fifty
years afterwards, he paid no attention to the special
conclusion. He was content to make the following
brief prophetic observation in his work: "Light will
be thrown on the origin and the history of man." Even
this innocent remark seemed so momentous to the first
German translator of the work, Bronn, that he suppressed
it. When Darwin was asked by Wallace
whether he would not go more fully into it, he replied:
"I think of avoiding the whole subject, as it is so much
involved in prejudice; though I quite admit that it is
the highest and most interesting problem for the
thinker."</p>

<p>The first thorough works of importance on the subject
appeared in 1863. Thomas Huxley in England, and
Carl Vogt in Germany, endeavoured to show that the
descent of man from the ape was a necessary consequence
of Darwinism, and to provide an empirical base
for the theory by every available argument. Huxley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
work on <cite>Man's Place in Nature</cite> was particularly valuable.
He first gave convincingly, in three lectures, the
empirical evidence on the subject&mdash;the natural history
of the anthropoid apes, the anatomical and embryological
relations of man to the next lowest animals, and the
recently discovered fossil human remains. I then (1866)
made the first attempt to establish the theory of evolution
comprehensively by research in anatomy and embryology,
and to determine the chief stages in the natural classification
of the vertebrates that must have been passed
through by our earlier vertebrate ancestors. Anthropology
thus becomes a part of zoology. In my <cite>History
of Creation</cite> I further developed these early evolutionary
sketches, and improvements were made in the successive
editions.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the great master, Darwin, had
decided to deal with this chief evolutionary problem
in a special work. The two volumes of his <cite>Descent
of Man</cite> appeared in 1871. They contained an able
discussion of sexual selection, or the selective influence
of sexual love and high psychic activities connected
therewith, and their significance in regard to the
origin of man. As this part of Darwin's work was
afterwards attacked with particular virulence, I will
say that, in my opinion, it is of the greatest importance,
not only for the general theory of evolution, but
also for psychology, anthropology, and æsthetics.</p>

<p>My own feeble early efforts (1866), not only to
establish the descent of man from the nearest
related apes, but also to determine more precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the long series of our earlier and lower vertebrate
ancestors, had not at all satisfied me. In particular,
I had had to leave unanswered in my <cite>General
Morphology</cite> the very interesting question: from which
invertebrate animals the vertebrate stem originally
came. A clear and unexpected light was thrown
on it some time afterwards by the astounding
discoveries of Kowalevsky, which revealed an essential
agreement in embryonic development between the
lowest vertebrate (Amphioxus) and a lowly tunicate
(Ascidia). In the succeeding years, the numerous
discoveries in connection with the formation of the
germinal layers in different animals so much enlarged
our embryological outlook that I was able to prove
the complete homology of the two-layered <i>gastrula</i> (a
cup-shaped embryonic form) in all the tissue-forming
animals (<i>metazoa</i>) in my <cite>Monograph on the Sponges</cite>.
From this I inferred, in virtue of the biogenetic law,
the common descent of all the metazoa from one and
the same gastrula-shaped stem-form, the <i>gastræa</i>. This
hypothetical stem-form, to which man's earliest multicellular
ancestors also belong, was afterwards proved
by Monticelli's observations to be still in existence.
The evolution of these very simple tissue-forming
animals from still simpler unicellular forms (<i>protozoa</i>)
is shown by the corresponding processes that we
witness in what is called the segmentation of the
ovum or gastrulation, in the development of the
two-layered germ from the single cell of the ovum.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these great advances of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
phylogeny, and with the support of many new discoveries
in comparative anatomy and embryology, in
which a number of distinguished observers were at
work, I was able in 1874 to venture on the first
attempt to trace continuously the whole story of man's
evolution. In doing so, I took my stand on the
firm ground of the biogenetic law, seeking to give
a phylogenetic cause for each fact of embryology.
My <cite>Evolution of Man</cite>, which made the first attempt
to accomplish this difficult task, was materially
improved and enlarged as new and important discoveries
were made. The latest edition (1903 [1904
in English]) contains thirty chapters distributed in
two volumes, the first of which deals with embryology
(or ontogeny), and the second with the
development of species (or phylogeny).</p>

<p>Though I was quite conscious that there were
bound to be gaps and weak points in these first
attempts to frame a natural anthropogeny, I had
hoped they would have some influence on modern
anthropology, and especially that the first sketches
of a genealogical tree of the animal world would
prove a stimulus to fresh research and improvement.
In this I was much mistaken. The dominant school
of anthropology, especially in Germany, declined to
suffer the introduction of the theory of evolution,
declaring it to be an unfounded hypothesis, and
described our carefully prepared ancestral trees as
mere figments. This was due, in the first place, to
the great authority of the founder and president (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
many years) of the German Anthropological Society,
Rudolf Virchow, as I briefly pointed out in the
previous chapter. In view of the great regard that
is felt for this distinguished scientist, and the extent
to which his powerful opposition prevented the spread
of the theory, it is necessary to deal more fully with
his position on the subject. I am still further constrained
to do this because of the erroneous views
of it that are circulating, and my own fifty years'
acquaintance with my eminent teacher enables me to
put them right.</p>

<p>Not one of Virchow's numerous pupils and friends
can appreciate more than I do his real services to
medical science. His <cite>Cellular Pathology</cite> (1858), his
thorough application of the cell-theory to the science of
disease, is, in my opinion, one of the greatest advances
made by modern medicine. I had the good fortune to
begin my medical studies at Würzburg in 1852, and to
spend six valuable terms under the personal guidance
of four biologists of the first rank&mdash;Albert Kölliker,
Rudolf Virchow, Franz Leydig and Carl Gegenbaur.
The great stimulus that I received from these distinguished
masters in every branch of comparative and
microscopic biology was the starting-point of my whole
training in that science, and enabled me subsequently to
follow with ease the higher intellectual flight of Johannes
Müller. From Virchow especially I learned, not only
the analytic art of careful observation and judicious
appreciation of the detailed facts of anatomy, but also
the synthetic conception of the whole human frame, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
profound conviction of the <em>unity</em> of our nature, the
inseparable connection of body and mind, to which
Virchow gave a fine expression in his classic essay on
"The Efforts to bring about Unity in Scientific Medicine"
(1849). The leading articles which he wrote at that
time for the Journal of Pathological Anatomy and
Physiology, which he had founded, contain much new
insight into the wonders of life, and a number of excellent
general reflections on their significance&mdash;pregnant ideas
that we can make direct use of for Monistic purposes.
In the controversy that broke out between empirical
rationalism and materialism and the older vitalism and
mysticism, he took the side of the former, and fought
together with Jacob Moleschott, Carl Vogt, and Ludwig
Büchner. I owe the firm conviction of the unity of
organic and inorganic nature, of the mechanical character
of all vital and psychic activity, which I have always
held to be the foundation of my Monistic system, in a
great measure to Virchow's teaching and the exhaustive
conversations I had with him when I was his assistant.
The profound views of the nature of the cell and the
independent individuality of these elementary organisms,
which he advanced in his great work <cite>Cellular Pathology</cite>,
remained guiding principles for me in the prolonged
studies that I made thirty years afterwards of the
organisation of the radiolaria and other unicellular
protists; and also in regard to the theory of the cell-soul,
which followed naturally from the psychological
study of it.</p>

<p>His life at Würtzburg was the most brilliant period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of Virchow's indefatigable scientific labours. A change
took place when he removed to Berlin in 1856. He
then occupied himself chiefly with political and social
and civic interests. In the last respect he has done so
much for Berlin and the welfare of the German people
that I need not enlarge on it. Nor will I go into his
self-sacrificing
and often thankless political work as leader
of the progressive party; there are differences of
opinion as to its value. But we must carefully examine
his peculiar attitude towards evolution, and especially
its chief application, the ape-theory. He was at first
favourable to it, then sceptical, and finally decidedly
hostile.</p>

<p>When the Lamarckian theory was brought to light
again by Darwin in 1859, many thought that it was
Virchow's vocation to take the lead in defending it.
He had made a thorough study of the problem of
heredity; he had realised the power of adaptation
through his study of pathological changes; and he had
been directed to the great question of the origin of man
by his anthropological studies. He was at that time
regarded as a determined opponent of all dogmas; he
combated transcendentalism either in the form of
ecclesiastical creeds or anthropomorphism. After 1862
he declared that "the possibility of a transition from
species to species was a necessity of science." When
I opened the first public discussion of Darwinism at
the Stettin scientific congress in 1863, Virchow and
Alexander Braun were among the few scientists who
would admit the subject to be important and deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the most careful study. When I sent to him in 1865
two lectures that I had delivered at Jena on the origin
and genealogical tree of the human race, he willingly
received them amongst his <cite>Collection of Popular
Scientific Lectures</cite>. In the course of many long conversations
I had with him on the matter, he agreed with
me in the main, though with the prudent reserve and
cool scepticism that characterised him. He adopts the
same moderate attitude in the lecture that he delivered
to the Artisans' Union at Berlin in 1869 on "Human
and Ape Skulls."</p>

<p>His position definitely changed in regard to
Darwinism from 1877 onward. At the Scientific
Congress that was then held at Munich I had, at
the pressing request of my Munich friends, undertaken
the first address (on 18th September) on "Modern
Evolution in Relation to the whole of Science." In
this address I had substantially advanced the same
general views that I afterwards enlarged in my <cite>Monism</cite>,
<cite>Riddle of the Universe</cite>, and <cite>Wonders of Life</cite>. In the
ultramontane capital of Bavaria, in sight of a great
university which emphatically describes itself as Catholic,
it was somewhat bold to make such a confession of
faith. The deep impression that it had made was
indicated by the lively manifestations of assent on the
one hand, and displeasure on the other, that were at
once made in the Congress itself and in the Press. On
the following day I departed for Italy (according to
an arrangement made long before). Virchow did not
come to Munich until two days afterwards, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
delivered (on 22nd September, in response to entreaties
from people of position and influence) his famous
antagonistic speech on "The Freedom of Science in
the Modern State." The gist of the speech was that
this freedom ought to be restricted; that evolution is
an unproved hypothesis, and ought not to be taught in
the school because it is dangerous to the State: "We
must not teach," he said, "that man descends from the
ape or any other animal." In 1849, the young Monist,
Virchow, had emphatically declared this conviction,
"that he would never be induced to deny the thesis
of the unity of human nature and its consequences";
now, twenty-eight years afterwards, the prudent Dualistic
politician entirely denied it. He had formerly taught
that all the bodily and mental processes in the human
organism depend on the mechanism of the cell-life;
now he declared the soul to be a special immaterial
entity. But the crowning feature of this reactionary
speech was his compromise with the Church,
which he had fought so vigorously twenty years
before.</p>

<p>The character of Virchow's speech at Munich is best
seen in the delight with which it was at once received
by the reactionary and clerical papers, and the profound
concern of all Liberal journals, either in the political or
the religious sense. When Darwin read the English
translation of the speech he&mdash;generally so gentle in his
judgments&mdash;wrote: "Virchow's conduct is shameful,
and I hope he will some day feel the shame." In 1878,
I made a full reply to it in my <cite>Free Science and Free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Teaching</cite>, in which I collected the most important
press opinions on the matter.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>From this very decided turn at Munich until his
death, twenty-five years afterwards, Virchow was an
indefatigable and very influential opponent of evolution.
In his annual appearances at congresses he has always
contested it, and has obstinately clung to his statement
that "it is quite certain that man does not descend from
the ape or any other animal." To the question:
"Whence does he come, then?" he had no answer,
and retired to the resigned position of the Agnostic,
which was common before Darwin's time: "We do not
know how life arose, and how the various species came
into the world." His son-in-law, Professor Rabl, has
tried to draw attention once more to his earlier conception,
and has declared that even in later years
Virchow often recognised the truth of evolution in
private conversation. This only makes it the more
regrettable that he always said the contrary in public.
The fact remains that ever since the opponents of
evolution, especially the reactionaries and clericals, have
appealed to the authority of Virchow.</p>

<p>The wholly reactionary system that this led to has
been well described by Robert Drill (1902) in his
<cite>Virchow as a Reactionary</cite>. How little qualified the
great pathologist was to appreciate the scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
bases of the pithecoid theory is clear from the
absurd statement he made, in the opening speech
of the Vienna Congress of Anthropologists, in 1894,
that man might just as well be claimed to descend
from a sheep or an elephant as from an ape. Any
competent zoologist can see from this the little
knowledge Virchow had of systematic zoology and
comparative anatomy. However, he retained his
authority as president of the German Anthropological
Society, which remained impervious to Darwinian
ideas. Even such vigorous controversialists as Carl
Vogt, and such scientific partisans of the ape-man
of Neanderthal as Schaafhausen, could make no
impression. Virchow's authority was equally great
for twenty years in the Berlin Press, both Liberal
and Conservative. The <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kreutzzeitung</cite> and the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Evangelische
Kirchenzeitung</cite> were delighted that "the
learned progressist was conservative in the best
sense of the word as regards evolution." The
ultramontane <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Germania</cite> rejoiced that the powerful
representative of pure science had, "with a few
strokes of his cudgel, reduced to impotence" the
absurd ape-theory and its chief protagonist, Ernst
Haeckel. The <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">National-Zeitung</cite> could not sufficiently
thank the free-thinking, popular leader for having
lifted from us for ever the oppressive mountain of
the theory of simian descent. The editor of the
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volks-Zeitung</cite>, Bernstein, who has done so much for
the spread of knowledge in his excellent popular
manuals of science, obstinately refused to admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
articles that ventured to support the erroneous
ape-theory "refuted" by Virchow.</p>

<p>It would take up too much space to attempt to
give even a general survey of the remarkable and
enormous literature of the subject that has accumulated
in the last three decades in the shape of
thousands of learned treatises and popular articles.
The greater part of these works have been written
under the influence of conventional religious prejudice,
and without the necessary acquaintance with the
subject, that can only be obtained by a thorough
training in biology. The most curious feature of
them is that most of the authors restrict their
genealogical interests to the most manlike apes, and
do not deal with their origin, or with the deeper
roots of our common ancestral tree. They do not
see the wood for the trees. Yet it is far easier and
safer to penetrate the great mysteries of our animal
origin, if we look at the subject from the higher
standpoint of vertebrate phylogeny and go deeper
into the earlier records of the evolutionary history
of the vertebrates.</p>

<p>Since the great Lamarck established the idea of
the vertebrate at the beginning of the nineteenth
century (1801), and his Parisian colleague, Cuvier,
shortly afterwards recognised the vertebrates as one
of his four chief animal groups, the natural unity of
this advanced section of the animal world has not
been contested. In all the vertebrates, from the
lowest fishes and amphibians up to the apes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
man, we have the same type of structure, the same
characteristic disposition and relations of the chief
organs; and they differ materially from the corresponding
features in all other animals. The mysterious
affinities of the vertebrates induced Goethe, 140 years
ago, long before Cuvier, to make prolonged and
laborious studies in their comparative anatomy at
Jena and Weimar. Just as he had, in his <cite>Metamorphosis
of Plants</cite>, established the unity of
organisation by means of the leaf as the common
primitive organ, he, in the metamorphosis of the
vertebrates, found this common element in the
vertebral theory of the skull. And when Cuvier
established comparative anatomy as an independent
science, this branch of biology was developed to
such an extent by the classic research of Johannes
Müller, Carl Gegenbaur, Richard Owen, Thomas
Huxley, and many other morphologists, that Darwinism
found its most powerful weapons in this arsenal.
The striking differences of external form and internal
structure that we find in the fishes, amphibians,
reptiles, birds, and mammals, are due to <em>adaptation</em>
to the various uses of their organs and their
environments. On the other hand, the astonishing
agreement in their typical character, that persists in
spite of their differences, is due to <em>inheritance</em> from
common ancestors.</p>

<p>The evidence thus afforded by comparative anatomy
is so cogent that anyone who goes impartially and
attentively through a collection of skeletons can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
convince himself at once of the morphological unity
of the vertebrate stem. The evolutionary evidence
of comparative ontogeny, or embryology, is less easy
to grasp and less accessible, but not less important.
It came to light at a much later date, and its
extreme value was only made clear, by means of the
biogenetic law, some forty years ago. It shows that
every vertebrate, like every other animal, develops
from a single cell, but that the course of its embryonic
development is peculiar, and characterised by embryonic
forms that are not found in the invertebrates. We
find in them especially the <i>chordula</i>, or chorda-larva,
a very simple worm-shaped embryonic form, without
limbs, head, or higher sense-organs; the body consists
merely of six very simple primitive organs. From
these are developed steadily the hundreds of different
bones, muscles, and other organs that we afterwards
distinguish in the mature vertebrate. The remarkable
and very complex course of this embryonic development
is essentially the same in man and the ape, and
in the amphibians and fishes. We see in it, in
accordance with the biogenetic law, a new and
important witness to the common descent of all
vertebrates from a single primitive form, the <i>chordæa</i>.</p>

<p>But, important as these arguments of comparative
embryology are, one needs many years' study in the
unfamiliar and difficult province of embryology before
one can realise their evolutionary force. There are,
in fact, not a few embryologists (especially of the
modern school of experimental embryology) who do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
not succeed in doing so. It is otherwise with the
palpable proofs that we take from a remote science,
paleontology. The remarkable fossil remains and
impressions of extinct animals and plants give us
directly the historical evidence we need to understand
the successive appearance and disappearance of the
various species and groups. Geology has firmly
established the chronological order of the sedimentary
rocks, which have been successively formed of mud
at the floor of the ocean, and has deduced their age
from the thickness of the strata, and determined the
relative date of their formation. The vast period
during which organic life has been developing on the
earth runs to many million years. The number is
variously estimated at less than a hundred or at
several hundred million years.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If we take the
smaller number of 200 million years, we find them
distributed amongst the five chief periods of the
earth's organic development in such a way that the
earlier or archeozoic period absorbs nearly one half.
As the sedimentary rocks of this period, chiefly
gneisses and crystalline schists, are in a metamorphosed
condition, the fossil remains in them are unrecognisable.
In the next succeeding strata of the paleozoic
period we find the earliest remains of fossilised
vertebrates, Silurian primitive fishes (selachii) and
ganoids. These are followed, in the Devonian system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by the first dipneust fishes (a transitional form from
the fishes to the amphibia). In the next, the
Carboniferous system, we find the first terrestrial or
four-footed vertebrates&mdash;amphibians of the order of
the stegocephala. A little later, in the Permian
rocks, the earliest amniotes, lowly, lizard-like reptiles
(tocosauria), make their appearance; the warm-blooded
birds and mammals are still wanting. We have the
first traces of the mammals in the Triassic, the earliest
sedimentary rocks of the mesozoic age; these are of
the monotreme sub-class (pantotheria and allotheria).
They are succeeded by the first marsupials
(prodidelphia) in the Jurassic, the ancestral forms of the
placentals (mallotheria), in the Cretaceous. See <a href="#Page_115">p. 115.</a></p>

<p>But the richest development of the mammal class
takes place in the next or Tertiary age. In the
course of its four periods&mdash;the eocene, oligocene,
miocene, and pliocene&mdash;the mammal species increase
steadily in number, variety, and complexity, down to
the present time. From the lowest common ancestral
group of the placentals proceed four divergent branches,
the legions of the carnassia, rodents, ungulates, and
primates. The primate legion surpasses all the rest.
In this Linné long ago included the lemurs, apes,
and man. The historical order in which the various
stages of vertebrate development make their successive
appearance corresponds entirely to the morphological
order of their advance in organisation, as we have
learned it from the study of comparative anatomy
and embryology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>These paleontological facts are among the most
important proofs of the descent of man from a long
series of higher and lower vertebrates. There is no
other explanation possible except evolution for the
chronological succession of these classes, which is in
perfect harmony with the morphological and systematic
distribution. The anti-evolutionists have not even
attempted to give any other explanation. The fishes,
dipneusts, amphibians, reptiles, monotremes, marsupials,
placentals, lemurs, apes, anthropoid apes, and ape-men
(pithecanthropi), are inseparable links of a long ancestral
chain, of which the last and most perfect link is man.
(<em>Cf.</em> the tables <a href="#Page_116">pp. 116-118</a>.)</p>

<p>One of the paleontological facts I have quoted,
namely, the late appearance of the mammal class in
geology&mdash;is particularly important. This most advanced
group of the vertebrates comes on the stage in the
Triassic period, in the second and shorter half of the
organic history of the earth. It is represented only by
low and small forms in the whole of the mesozoic age,
during the domination of the reptiles. Throughout this
long period, which is estimated by some geologists at
8-11, by others at 20 or more, million years, the
dominant reptile class developed its many remarkable
and curious forms; there were swimming marine reptiles
(halisauria), flying reptiles (pterosauria), and colossal
land reptiles (dinosauria). It was much later, in the
Tertiary period, that the mammal class attained the
wealth of large and advanced placental forms that
secured its predominance over this more recent period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The many and thorough investigations made during
the last few decades into the ancestral history of the
mammals have convinced all zoologists who were
engaged in them that they may be traced to a common
root. All the mammals, from the lowest monotremes
and marsupials to the ape and man, have a large number
of striking characteristics in common, and these
distinguish them from all other vertebrates: the hair
and glands of the skin, the feeding of the young with
the mother's milk, the peculiar formation of the lower
jaw and the ear-bones connected therewith, and other
features in the structure of the skull; also, the possession
of a knee-cap (<i>patella</i>), and the loss of the nucleus in
the red blood-cells. Further, the complete diaphragm,
which entirely separates the pectoral cavity from the
abdominal, is only found in the mammals; in all the
other vertebrates there is still an open communication
between the two cavities. The monophyletic (or single)
origin of the whole mammalian class is therefore now
regarded by all competent experts as an established
fact.</p>

<p>In the face of this important fact, what is called the
"ape-question" loses a good deal of the importance
that was formerly ascribed to it. All the momentous
consequences that follow from it in regard to our human
nature, our past and future, and our bodily and psychic
life, remain undisturbed whether we derive man directly
from one of the primates, an ape or lemur, or from some
other branch, some unknown lower form, of the
mammalian stem. It is important to point this out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
because certain dangerous attempts have been made
lately by Jesuitical zoologists and zoological Jesuits to
cause fresh confusion on the matter.</p>

<p>In a richly illustrated and widely read work that
Hans Kraemer published a few years ago, under the
title, <cite>The Universe and Man</cite>, an able and learned
anthropologist, Professor Klaatsch of Heidelberg, deals
with "the origin and development of the human race,"
and admirably describes the primitive history of man
and his civilisation. However, he denounces the idea
of man's descent from the ape as "irrational, narrow-minded,
and false"; he grounds this severe censure
on the fact that none of the living apes can be the
ancestor of humanity. But no competent scientist had
ever said anything so foolish. If we look closer into
this fight with windmills, we find that Klaatsch holds
substantially the same view of the pithecoid theory
as I have done since 1866. He says expressly: "The
three anthropoid apes, the gorilla, chimpanzee, and
orang, seem to diverge from a common root, which
was near to that of the gibbon and man." I had long
ago given the name of <em>archiprimas</em> to this single
hypothetical root-form of the primates, which he calls
the "primatoid." It lived in the earliest part of the
Tertiary period, and had probably been developed in
the Cretaceous from older mammals. The very
forced and unnatural hypothesis by means of which
Klaatsch goes on to make the primates depart very
widely from the other mammals, seems to me to be
quite untenable, like the similar hypothesis that Alsberg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Wilser, and other anthropologists who deny our
pithecoid descent, have lately advanced.</p>

<p>All these attempts have a common object&mdash;to save
man's privileged position in Nature, to widen as much
as possible the gulf between him and the rest of the
mammals, and to conceal his real origin. It is the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'familar tendency'">familiar tendency</ins> of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenu</i>, which we so often
notice in the aristocratic sons of energetic men who
have won a high position by their own exertions.
This sort of vanity is acceptable enough to the ruling
powers and the Churches, because it tends to support
their own fossilised pretensions to a "Divine image"
in man and a special "Divine grace" in princes. The
zoologist or anthropologist who studies our genealogy
in a strictly scientific spirit takes no more notice of
these tendencies than of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Almanach de Gotha</cite>. He
seeks to discover the naked truth, as it is yielded by
the great results of modern science, in which there
is no longer any doubt that man is really a descendant
of the ape&mdash;that is to say, of a long extinct anthropoid
ape. As has been pointed out over and over again
by distinguished supporters of this opinion, the
proofs of it are exceptionally clear and simple&mdash;much
clearer and simpler than they are in regard to many
other mammals. Thus, for instance, the origin of
the elephants, the armadilloes, the sirena, or the whales,
is a much more difficult problem than the origin of man.</p>

<p>When Huxley published his powerful essay on
"Man's Place in Nature" in 1863, he gave it a frontispiece
showing the skeletons of man and the four living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
anthropoid apes, the Asiatic orang and gibbon, and the
African chimpanzee and gorilla. Plate II. in the present
work differs from this in giving two young specimens of
the orang and the chimpanzee, and raising their size
to correspond with the other three skeletons. Candid
comparison of these five skeletons shows that they are
not only very like each other generally, but are <em>identical</em>
in the structure, arrangement, and connection of all the
parts. The same 200 bones compose the skeleton in
man and in the four tailless anthropoid apes, our nearest
relatives. The same 300 muscles serve to move the
various parts of the skeleton. The same hair covers the
skin; the same mammary glands provide food for the
young. The same four-chambered heart acts as central
pump of the circulation; the same 32 teeth are found in
our jaws; the same reproductive organs maintain the
species; the same groups of neurona or ganglionic cells
compose the wondrous structure of the brain, and
accomplish that highest function of the plasm which we
call the soul, and many still believe to be an immortal
entity. Huxley has thoroughly established this profound
truth, and by further comparison with the lower apes
and lemurs he came to formulate his important pithecometra
principle: "Whatever organ we take, the
differences between man and the anthropoid apes are
slighter than the corresponding differences between the
latter and the lower apes." If we make a superficial
comparison of our skeletons of the anthropomorpha, we
certainly notice a few salient differences in the size of
the various parts; but these are purely quantitative, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
are due to differences in growth, which in turn are caused
by adaptation to different environments. There are, as
is well known, similar differences between human beings;
their arms are sometimes long, sometimes short; the
forehead may be high or low, the hair thick or thin, and
so on.</p>

<p>These anatomic proofs of the pithecoid theory are
most happily supplemented and confirmed by certain
recent brilliant discoveries in physiology. Chief amongst
these are the famous experiments of Dr. Hans
Friedenthal at Berlin. He showed that the human
blood acts poisonously on and decomposes the blood of
the lower apes and other mammals, but has not that
effect on the blood of the anthropoid apes.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>From previous transfusion experiments it had been
learned that the affinity of mammals is connected to a
certain extent with their chemical blood-relationship.
If the living blood of two nearly related animals of the
same family, such as the dog and the fox, or the rabbit
and the hare, is mixed together, the living blood-cells
of each species remain uninfluenced. But if we mix the
blood of the dog and the rabbit, or the fox and the hare,
a struggle for life immediately takes place between the
two kinds of blood-cells. The watery fluid or serum
destroys the blood-cells of the rodent, and <em>vice versâ</em>.
It is the same with specimens of the blood of the various
primates. The blood of the lower apes and lemurs,
which are close to the common root of the primate stem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
has a destructive effect on the blood of the anthropoid
apes and man, and <em>vice versâ</em>. On the other hand, the
human blood has no injurious effect when it is mixed
with that of the anthropoid apes.</p>

<p>In recent years these interesting experiments have
been continued by other physiologists and physicians,
such as Professor Uhlenhuth at Greifswald and Nuttall
at London, and they have proved directly the blood-relationship
of various mammals. Nuttall studied
them carefully in 900 different kinds of blood, which
he tested by 16,000 reactions. He traced the gradation
of affinity to the lowest apes of the New World;
and Uhlenhuth continued as far as the lemurs. By
these results the affinity of man and the anthropoid
apes, long established by anatomy, has now been
proved physiologically to be in real "blood-relationship."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Not less important are the embryological discoveries
of the deceased zoologist, Emil Selenka. He made
two long journeys to the East Indies, in order to
study on the spot the embryology of the Asiatic
anthropoid apes, the orang and gibbon. By means
of a number of embryos that he collected he showed
that certain remarkable peculiarities in the formation
of the placenta, that had up to that time been considered
as exclusively human, and regarded as a
special distinction of our species, were found in just
the same way in the closely related anthropoid apes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
though not in the rest of the apes. On the ground
of these and other facts, I maintain that the descent
of man from extinct Tertiary anthropoid apes is proved
just as plainly as the descent of birds from reptiles,
or the descent of reptiles from amphibians, which no
zoologist hesitates to admit to-day. The relationship
is as close as was claimed by my former fellow-student,
the Berlin anatomist, Robert Hartmann (with whom
I sat at the feet of Johannes Müller fifty years ago),
in his admirable work on the anthropoid apes (1883).
He proposed to divide the order of primates into
two families, the <i>primarii</i> (man and the anthropoid
apes), and <i>simianæ</i> (the real apes, the catarrhine or
eastern, and the platyrrhine or western apes).</p>

<p>Since the Dutch physician, Eugen Dubois, discovered
the famous remains of the fossil ape-man
(<i>pithecanthropus erectus</i>) eleven years ago in Java, and
thus brought to light "the missing link," a large
number of works have been published on this very
interesting group of the primates. In this connection
we may particularly note the demonstration by the
Strassburg anatomist, Gustav Schwalbe, that the
previously discovered Neanderthal skull belongs to an
extinct species of man, which was midway between
the pithecanthropus and the true human being&mdash;the
<i>homo primigenus</i>. After a very careful examination,
Schwalbe at the same time refuted all the biassed
objections that Virchow had made to these and other
fossil discoveries, trying to represent them as pathological
abnormalities. In all the important relics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
fossil men that prove our descent from anthropoid
apes Virchow saw pathological modifications, due to
unsound habits, gout, rickets, or other diseases of
the dwellers in the diluvial caves. He tried in
every way to impair the force of the arguments for
our primate affinity. So in the controversy over
the pithecanthropus he raised the most improbable
conjectures, merely for the purpose of destroying its
significance as a real link between the anthropoid
apes and man.</p>

<p>Even now, in the controversy over this important
ape-question, amateurs and biassed anthropologists often
repeat the false statement that the gap between man
and the anthropoid ape is not yet filled up and the
"missing link" not yet discovered. This is a most
perverse statement, and can only arise either from
ignorance of the anatomical, embryological, and
paleontological facts, or incompetence to interpret
them aright. As a fact, the morphological chain that
stretches from the lemurs to the earlier western apes,
from these to the eastern tailed apes, and to the tailless
anthropoid apes, and from these direct to man, is now
uninterrupted and clear. It would be more plausible
to speak of missing links between the earliest lemurs
and their marsupial ancestors, or between the latter and
their monotreme ancestors. But even these gaps
are unimportant, because comparative anatomy and
embryology, with the support of paleontology, have
dissipated all doubt as to the <em>unity of the mammalian
stem</em>. It is ridiculous to expect paleontology to furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
an unbroken series of positive data, when we remember
how scanty and imperfect its material is.</p>

<p>I cannot go further here into the interesting recent
research in regard to special aspects of our simian
descent; nor would it greatly advance our object,
because all the general conclusions as to man's primate
descent remain intact, whichever way we construct
hypothetically the special lines of simian evolution. On
the other hand, it is interesting for us to see how the
most recent form of Darwinism, so happily described by
Escherich as "ecclesiastical evolution," stands in regard
to these great questions. What does its astutest representative,
Father Erich Wasmann, say about them?
The tenth chapter of his work, in which he deals at
length with "the application of the theory of evolution
to man," is a masterpiece of Jesuitical science, calculated
to throw the clearest truths into such confusion
and so to misrepresent all discoveries as to prevent any
reader from forming a clear idea of them. When we
compare this tenth chapter with the ninth, in which
Wasmann represents the theory of evolution as an
irresistible truth on the strength of his own able studies,
we can hardly believe that they both came from the
same pen&mdash;or, rather, we can only understand when we
recollect the rule of the Jesuit Congregation: "The
end justifies the means." Untruth is permitted and
meritorious in the service of God and his Church.</p>

<p>The Jesuitical sophistry that Wasmann employs in
order to save man's unique position in Nature, and
to prove that he was immediately created by God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
culminates in the antithesis of his two natures. The
"purely zoological conception of man," which has
been established beyond question by the anatomical
and embryological comparison with the ape, is said
to fail because it does not take into account the chief
feature, his "mental life." It is "psychology that is
best fitted to deal with the nature and origin of
man." All the facts of anatomy and embryology that
I have gathered together in my <cite>Evolution of Man</cite> in
proof of the series of his ancestors are either ignored
or misconstrued and made ridiculous by Wasmann.
The same is done with the instructive facts of
anthropology, especially the rudimentary organs,
which Robert Wiedersheim has quoted in his <cite>Man's
Structure as a Witness to his Past</cite>. It is clear that
the Jesuit writer lacks competence in this department;
that he has only a superficial and inadequate acquaintance
with comparative anatomy and embryology. If
Wasmann had studied the morphology and physiology
of the mammals as thoroughly as those of the ants,
he would have concluded, if he were impartial, that
it is just as necessary to admit a monophyletic (or
single) origin for the former as for the latter. If, in
Wasmann's opinion, the 4,000 species of ants form
a single "natural system"&mdash;that is to say, descend
from one original species&mdash;it is just as necessary to
admit the same hypothesis for the 6,000 (2,400 living
and 3,600 fossil) species of mammals, including the
human species.</p>

<p>The severe strictures that I have passed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sophisms and trickery of this "ecclesiastical evolution"
are not directed against the person and the character
of Father Wasmann, but the Jesuitical system which
he represents. I do not doubt that this able naturalist
(who is personally unknown to me) has written his
book in good faith, and has an honourable ambition
to reconcile the irreconcilable contradictions between
natural evolution and the story of supernatural
creation. But this reconciliation of reason and
superstition is only possible at the price of a sacrifice
of the reason itself. We find this in the case of all
the other Jesuits&mdash;Fathers Cathrein, Braun, Besmer,
Cornet, Linsmeier, and Muckermann&mdash;whose ambiguous
"Jesuitical science" is aptly dealt with in the article
of R. H. Francé that I mentioned before (No. 22 of
the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freie Wort</cite>, 16th February, 1904, Frankfort).</p>

<p>This interesting attempt of Father Wasmann's does
not stand alone. Signs are multiplying that the
Church militant is about to enter on a systematic
campaign. I heard from Vienna on the 17th of
February, that on the previous day (which happened
to be my birthday), a Jesuit, Father Giese, had, in a
well-received address, admitted not only evolution in
general, but even its application to man, and declared
it to be reconcilable with Catholic dogmas&mdash;and this
at a crowded meeting of "catechists"! It is important
to note that in a new Catholic cyclopædia, Benziger's
<cite>Library of Science</cite>, the first three volumes (issued at
Einsiedeln and Cologne, 1904) deal very fully and ably
with the chief problems of evolution: the first with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the formation of the earth, the second with spontaneous
generation, the third with the theory of descent. The
author of them, Father M. Gander, makes most
remarkable concessions to our theory, and endeavours
to show that they are not inconsistent with the Bible
or the dogmatic treatises of the chief fathers and schoolmen.
But, though there is a profuse expenditure of
sophistical logic in these Jesuitical efforts, Gander will
hardly succeed in misleading thoughtful people. One
of his characteristic positions is that spontaneous generation
(as the development of organised living things by
purely material processes) is inconceivable, but that it
might be made possible "by a special Divine arrangement."
In regard to the descent of man from other
animals (which he grants), he makes the reserve that
the soul must in any case have been produced by a
special creative act.</p>

<p>It would be useless to go through the innumerable
fallacies and untruths of these modern Jesuits in detail,
and point out the rational and scientific reply. The
vast power of this most dangerous religious congregation
consists precisely in its device of accepting one
part of science in order to destroy the other part more
effectively with it. Their masterly act of sophistry,
their equivocal "probabilism," their mendacious
"reservatio mentalis," the principle that the higher
aim sanctifies the worst means, the pernicious casuistry
of Liguori and Gury, the cynicism with which they
turn the holiest principles to the gratification of their
ambition, have impressed on the Jesuits that black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
character that Carl Hoensbroech has so well exposed
recently.</p>

<p>The great dangers that menace real science, owing
to this smuggling into it of the Jesuitical spirit, must
not be undervalued. They have been well pointed
out by Francé, Escherich, and others. They are all
the greater in Germany at the present time, as the
Government and the Reichstag are working together
to prepare the way for the Jesuits, and to yield a
most pernicious influence on the school to these
deadly enemies of the free spirit of the country.
However, we will hope that this clerical reaction
represents only a passing episode in modern history.
We trust that one permanent result of it will be the
recognition, in principle, even by the Jesuits, of the
great idea of evolution. We may then rest assured
that its most important consequence, the descent of
man from other primate forms, will press on victoriously,
and soon be recognised as a beneficent and
helpful truth.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">Though it was my original intention to deliver only
two lectures, I have been moved by several reasons
to add a supplementary one. In the first place, I
notice with regret that I have been compelled by
pressure of time to leave untouched in my earlier
lectures, or to treat very inadequately, several important
points in my theme; there is, in particular, the very
important question of the nature of the soul. In the
second place, I have been convinced by the many
contradictory press-notices during the last few days
that many of my incomplete observations have been
misunderstood or misinterpreted. And, thirdly, it
seemed advisable to give a brief and clear summary
of the whole subject in this farewell lecture, to take
a short survey of the past, present, and future of the
theory of evolution, and especially its relation to the
three great questions of personal immortality, the
freedom of the will, and the personality of God.</p>

<p>I must claim the reader's patience and indulgence
even to a greater extent than in the previous chapters,
as the subject is one of the most difficult and obscure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that the human mind approaches. I have dealt at
length in my recent works, <cite>The Riddle of the Universe</cite>
and <cite>The Wonders of Life</cite>, with the controversial questions
of biology that I treat cursorily here. But I would like
to put before you now, in a general survey, the powerful
arguments that modern science employs against the prevailing
superstition in regard to evolution, and to show
that the Monistic system throws a clear light on the great
questions of God and the world, the soul and life.</p>

<p>In the previous chapters I have tried to give a general
idea of the present state of the theory of evolution and
its victorious struggle with the older legend of creation.
We have seen that even the most advanced organism,
man, was not brought into being by a creative act, but
gradually developed from a long series of mammal
ancestors. We also saw that the most man-like
mammals, the anthropoid apes, have substantially the
same structure as man, and that the evolution of the
latter from the former can now be regarded as a fully
established hypothesis, or, rather, an historical fact. But
in this study we had in view mainly the structure of the
body and its various organs. We touched very briefly on
the evolution of the human mind, or the immaterial soul
that dwells in the body for a time, according to a
venerable tradition. To-day we turn chiefly to the
development of the soul, and consider whether man's
mental development is controlled by the same natural
laws as that of his body, and whether it also is inseparably
bound up with that of the rest of the mammals.</p>

<p>At the very threshold of this difficult province we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
encounter the curious fact that there are two radically
distinct tendencies in psychology at our universities
to-day. On one side we have the metaphysical
and professional psychologists. They still cling to
the older view that man's soul is a special entity, a
unique independent individuality, which dwells for a time
only in the mortal frame, leaving it and living on as an
immortal spirit after death. This dualistic theory is
connected with the doctrine of most religions, and owes
its high authority to the fact that it is associated with the
most important ethical, social, and practical interests.
Plato gave prominence to the idea of the immortality of
the soul in philosophy long ago. Descartes at a later
date gave emphasis to it by ascribing a true soul to man
alone and refusing it to the animals.</p>

<p>This metaphysical psychology, which ruled alone for a
considerable period, began to be opposed in the eighteenth,
and still more in the nineteenth, century by <em>comparative
psychology</em>. An impartial comparison of the psychic
processes in the higher and lower animals proved that
there were numerous transitions and gradations. A long
series of intermediate stages connects the psychic life of
the higher animals with that of man on the one side,
and that of the lower animals on the other. There was no
such thing as a sharp dividing line, as Descartes supposed.</p>

<p>But the greatest blow was dealt at the predominant
metaphysical conception of the life of the soul thirty years
ago by the new methods of <em>psychophysics</em>. By means of
a series of able experiments the physiologists, Theodor
Fechner and Ernst Heinrich Weber of Leipsic, showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that an important part of the mental activity can be
measured and expressed in mathematical formulæ just
as well as other physiological processes, such as muscular
contractions. Thus the laws of physics control a part
of the life of the soul just as absolutely as they do the
phenomena of inorganic nature. It is true that psychophysics
has only partially realised the very high
expectations that were entertained in regard to its
Monistic significance; but the fact remains that a part
of the mental life is just as unconditionally ruled by
physical laws as any other natural phenomena.</p>

<p>Thus <em>physiological psychology</em> was raised by psychophysics
to the rank of a physical and, in principle, exact
science. But it had already obtained solid foundations
in other provinces of biology. Comparative psychology
had traced connectedly the long gradation from man to
the higher animals, from these to the lower, and so on
down to the very lowest. At the lowest stage it found those
remarkable beings, invisible with the naked eye, that were
discovered in stagnant water everywhere after the invention
of the microscope (in the second half of the seventeenth
century) and called "infusoria." They were first
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'acurately described'">accurately described</ins> and classified by Gottfried Ehrenberg,
the famous Berlin microscopist. In 1838 he published
a large and beautiful work, illustrating on 64 folio pages
the whole realm of microscopic life; and this is still the
base of all studies of the protists. Ehrenberg was a
very ardent and imaginative observer, and succeeded in
communicating his zeal for the study of microscopic
organisms to his pupils. I still recall with pleasure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stimulating excursions that I made fifty years ago (in
the summer of 1854) with my teacher, Ehrenberg, and
a few other pupils&mdash;including my student-friend,
Ferdinand von Richthofen, the famous geographer&mdash;to
the Zoological Gardens at Berlin. Equipped with fine
nets and small glasses, we fished in the ponds of the
Zoological Gardens and in the Spree, and caught
thousands of invisible micro-organisms, which then richly
rewarded our curiosity by the beautiful forms and
mysterious movements they disclosed under the
microscope.</p>

<p>The way in which Ehrenberg explained to us the
structure and the vital movements of his infusoria was
very curious. Misled by the comparison of the real
infusoria with the microscopic but highly organised
rotifers, he had formed the idea that all animals are
alike advanced in organisation, and had indicated this
erroneous theory in the very title of his work: <cite>The
Infusoria as Perfect Organisms: a Glance at the Deeper
Life of Organic Nature</cite>. He thought he could detect
in the simplest infusoria the same distinct organs as in
the higher animals&mdash;stomach, heart, ovaries, kidneys,
muscles, and nerves&mdash;and he interpreted their psychic
life on the same peculiar principle of equally advanced
organisation.</p>

<p>Ehrenberg's theory of life was entirely wrong, and
was radically destroyed in the hour of its birth (1838)
by the cell-theory which was then formulated, and to
which he never became reconciled. Once Matthias
Schleiden had shown the composition of all the plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tissues, and organs from microscopic cells, the last
structural elements of the living organism, and Theodor
Schwann had done the same for the animal body, the
theory attained such an importance that Kölliker and
Leydig based on it the modern science of tissues, or
histology, and Virchow constructed his cellular pathology
by applying it to diseased human beings. These are the
most important advances of theoretical medicine. But
it was still a long time before the difficult question of
the relation of these microscopic beings to the cell was
answered. Carl Theodor von Siebold had already
maintained (in 1845) that the real infusoria and the
closely related rhizopods were <em>unicellular organisms</em>,
and had distinguished these <i>protozoa</i> from the rest of
the animals. At the same time, Carl Naegeli had
described the lowest algæ as "unicellular plants." But
this important conception was not generally admitted
until some time afterwards, especially after I brought all
the unicellular organisms under the head of "protists"
(1872), and defined their psychic functions as the
"cell-soul."</p>

<p>I was led to make a very close study of these
unicellular protists and their primitive cell-soul through
my research on the radiolaria, a very remarkable class
of microscopic organisms that float in the sea. I was
engaged most of my time for more than thirty of the
best years of my life (1856-87) in studying them in every
aspect, and if I came eventually to adopt a strictly
Monistic attitude on all the great questions of biology,
I owe it for the most part to my innumerable observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and uninterrupted reflections on the wonderful vital
movements that are disclosed by these smallest and
frailest, and at the same time most beautiful and varied,
of living things.</p>

<p>I had undertaken the study of the radiolaria as a
kind of souvenir of my great master, Johannes Müller.
He had loved to study these animals (of which only a
few species were discovered for the first time in the
year of my birth, 1834) in the last years of his life, and
had in 1855 set up the special group of the rhizopods
(protozoa). His last work, which appeared shortly after
his death (1858), and contained a description of 50
species of radiolaria, went with me to the Mediterranean
when I made my first long voyage in the summer of
1859. I was so fortunate as to discover about 150 new
species of radiolaria at Messina, and based on these my
first monograph of this very instructive class of protists
(1862). I had no suspicion at that time that fifteen
years afterwards the deep-sea finds of the famous
<em>Challenger</em> expedition would bring to light an incalculable
wealth of these remarkable animals. In my
second monograph on them (1887), I was able to describe
more than 4,000 different species of radiolaria, and
illustrate most of them on 140 plates. I have given a
selection of the prettiest forms on ten plates of my
<cite>Art-forms in Nature</cite>.</p>

<p>I have not space here to go into the forms and
vital movements of the radiolaria, of the general import
of which my friend, Wilhelm Bölsche, has given a very
attractive account in his various popular works. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
restrict myself to pointing out the general phenomena
that bear upon our particular subject, the question of
the mind. The pretty flinty skeletons of the radiolaria,
which enclose and protect the soft unicellular body, are
remarkable, not only for their extraordinary gracefulness
and beauty, but also for the geometrical regularity and
relative constancy of their forms. The 4,000 species
of radiolaria are just as constant as the 4,000 known
species of ants; and, as the Darwinian Jesuit, Father
Wasmann, has convinced himself that the latter have
all descended by transformation from a common stem-form,
I have concluded on the same principles that the
4,000 species of radiolaria have developed from a
primitive form in virtue of adaptation and heredity.
This primitive form, the stem-radiolarian (<i>Actissa</i>) is
a simple round cell, the soft living protoplasmic body of
which is divided into two different parts, an inner
central capsule (in the middle of which is the solid round
nucleus) and an outer gelatinous envelope (<i>calymma</i>).
From the outer surface of the latter, hundreds and
thousands of fine plasmic threads radiate; these are
mobile and sensitive processes of the living internal
substance, the plasm (or protoplasm). These delicate
microscopic threads, or pseudopodia, are the curious
organs that effect the sensations (of touch), the locomotion
(by pushing), and the orderly construction of the
flinty house; at the same time, they maintain the
nourishment of the unicellular body, by seizing infusoria,
diatoms, and other protists, and drawing them
within the plasmic body, where they are digested and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
assimilated. The radiolaria generally reproduce by the
formation of spores. The nucleus within the protoplasmic
globule divides into two small nuclei, each of
which surrounds itself with a quantity of plasm, and
forms a new cell.</p>

<p>What is this plasm? What is this mysterious "living
substance" that we find everywhere as the material
foundation of the "wonders of life"? Plasm, or protoplasm,
is, as Huxley rightly said thirty years ago, "the
physical basis of organic life"; to speak more precisely,
it is a chemical compound of carbon that alone accomplishes
the various processes of life. In its simplest
form the living cell is merely a soft globule of plasm,
containing a firmer nucleus. The inner nuclear matter
(called caryoplasm) differs somewhat in chemical composition
from the outer cellular matter (or cytoplasm);
but both substances are composed of carbon, oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur; both belong to the
remarkable group of the albuminates, the nitrogenous
carbonates that are distinguished for the extraordinary
size of their molecules and the unstable arrangement
of the numerous atoms (more than a thousand) that
compose them.</p>

<p>There are, however, still simpler organisms in
which the nucleus and the body of the cell have not
yet been differentiated. These are the <i>monera</i>, the
whole living body of which is merely a homogeneous
particle of plasm (the chromacea and bacteria). The
well-known bacteria which now play so important a
part as the causes of most dangerous infectious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
diseases, and the agents of putrefaction, fermentation,
etc., show very clearly that organic life is only a
chemical and physical process, and not the outcome
of a mysterious "vital force."</p>

<p>We see this still more clearly in our radiolaria, and
at the same time they show us unmistakably that
even the psychic activity is such a physico-chemical
process. All the different functions of their cell-soul,
the sense-perception of stimuli, the movement of their
plasm, their nutrition, growth, and reproduction, are
determined by the particular chemical composition of
each of the 4,000 species; and they have all
descended, in virtue of adaptation and heredity, from
the common stem-form of the naked, round parent-radiolarian
(<i>Actissa</i>).</p>

<p>We may instance, as a peculiarly interesting fact in
the psychic life of the unicellular radiolaria, the extraordinary
power of memory in them. The relative
constancy with which the 4,000 species transmit the
orderly and often very complex form of their
protective flinty structure from generation to generation
can only be explained by admitting in the
builders, the invisible plasma-molecules of the
pseudopodia, a fine "plastic sense of distance," and a
tenacious recollection of the architectural power of
their fathers. The fine, formless plasma-threads are
always building afresh the same delicate flinty shells
with an artistic trellis-work, and with protective
radiating needles and supports always at the same
points of their surface. The physiologist, Ewald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Hering (of Leipsic), had spoken in 1870 of memory as
"a general function of organised matter." I myself had
tried to explain the molecular features of heredity by
the memory of the plasma-molecules, in my essay on
"The Perigenesis of the Plastidules" (1875). Recently
one of the ablest of my pupils, Professor Richard Semon
(of Munich, 1904), made a profound study of "Mneme
as the principle of constancy in the changes of organic
phenomena," and reduced the mechanical process of
reproduction to a purely physiological base.</p>

<p>From the cell-soul and its memory in the radiolaria
and other unicellular protists, we pass directly to the
similar phenomenon in the ovum, the unicellular
starting-point of the individual life, from which the
complex multicellular frame of all the histona, or
tissue-forming animals and plants, is developed.
Even the human organism is at first a simple
nucleated globule of plasm, about<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">125</span>
</span> inch in diameter,
barely visible to the naked eye as a tiny point.
This stem-cell (<i>cytula</i>) is formed at the moment when
the ovum is fertilised, or mingled with the small
male spermatozoon. The ovum transmits to the
child by heredity the personal traits of the mother,
the sperm-cell those of the father; and this hereditary
transmission extends to the finest characteristics of
the soul as well as of the body. The modern research
as to heredity, which occupies so much space now in
biological literature, but was only started by Darwin
in 1859, is directed immediately to the visible material
processes of impregnation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The very interesting and important phenomena of
impregnation have only been known to us in detail for
thirty years. It has been shown conclusively, after a
number of delicate investigations, that the individual
development of the embryo from the stem-cell or fertilised
ovum is controlled by the same laws in all cases. The
stem-cell divides and subdivides rapidly into a number
of simple cells. From these a few simple organs, the
germinal layers, are formed at first; later on the various
organs, of which there is no trace in the early embryo,
are built up out of these. The biogenetic law teaches
us how, in this development, the original features of the
ancestral history are reproduced or recapitulated in the
embryonic processes; and these facts in turn can only be
explained by the unconscious memory of the plasm, the
"<i>mneme</i> of the living substance" in the germ-cells, and
especially in their nuclei.</p>

<p>One important result of these modern discoveries was
the prominence given to the fact that the personal soul
has a beginning of existence, and that we can determine
the precise moment in which this takes place; it is when
the parent cells, the ovum and spermatozoon, coalesce.
Hence what we call the soul of man or the animal has
not pre-existed, but begins its career at the moment of
impregnation; it is bound up with the chemical constitution
of the plasm, which is the material vehicle of
heredity in the nucleus of the maternal ovum and the
paternal spermatozoon. One cannot see how a being
that thus has a beginning of existence can afterwards
prove to be "immortal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, a candid examination of the simple cell-soul in
the unicellular infusoria, and of the dawn of the individual
soul in the unicellular germ of man and the higher
animals, proves at once that psychic action does not
necessarily postulate a fully formed nervous system, as
was previously believed. There is no such system in
many of the lower animals, or any of the plants, yet we
find psychic activities, especially sensation, irritability, and
reflex action everywhere. All living plasm has a psychic
life, and in this sense the psyche is a partial function of
organic life generally. But the higher psychic functions,
particularly the phenomena of consciousness, only appear
gradually in the higher animals, in which (in consequence
of a division of labour among the organs) the nervous
system has assumed these functions.</p>

<p>It is particularly interesting to glance at the central
nervous system of the vertebrates, the great stem of
which we regard ourselves as the crowning point. Here
again the anatomical and embryological facts speak a
clear and unambiguous language. In all vertebrates,
from the lowest fishes up to man, the psychic organ
makes its appearance in the embryo in the same form&mdash;a
simple cylindrical tube on the dorsal side of the
embryonic body, in the middle line. The anterior
section of this "medullary tube" expands into a club-shaped
vesicle, which is the beginning of the brain; the
posterior and thinner section becomes the spinal cord.
The cerebral vesicle divides, by transverse constrictions,
into three, then four, and eventually five vesicles. The
most important of these is the first, the <i>cerebrum</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
organ of the highest psychic functions. The more the
intelligence develops in the higher vertebrates, the
larger, more voluminous, and more specialised does the
cerebrum become. In particular, the grey mantle or
cortex of the cerebrum, its most important part, only
attains in the higher mammals the degree of quantitative
and qualitative development that qualifies it to be the
"organ of mind" in the narrower sense. Through the
famous discoveries of Paul Flechsig eleven years ago we
were enabled to distinguish eight fields in the cortex,
four of which serve as the internal centres of sense-perception,
and the four that lie between these are the
thought-centres (or association-centres) of the higher
psychic faculties&mdash;the association of impressions, the
formation of ideas and concepts, induction and deduction.
This real organ of mind, the <i>phronema</i>, is not yet
developed in the lower mammals. It is only gradually
built up in the more advanced, exactly in proportion
as their intelligence increases. It is only in the most
intelligent forms of the placentals, the higher ungulates
(horse, elephant), the carnivores (fox, dog), and especially
the primates, that the phronema attains the high
grade of development that leads us from the anthropoid
apes direct to the savage, and from him to civilised
man.</p>

<p>We have learned a good deal about the special significance
of the various parts of the brain, as organs of
specific functions, by the progress of the modern science
of experimental physiology. Careful experiments by
Goltz, Munk, Bernard, and many other physiologists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
have shown that the normal consciousness, speech, and
the internal sense-perceptions, are connected with
definite areas of the cortex, and that these various <em>parts
of the soul</em> are destroyed when the organic areas connected
with them are injured. But in this respect
Nature has unconsciously given us the most instructive
experiments. Diseases in these various areas show how
their functions are partially or totally extinguished when
the cerebral cells that compose them (the <i>neurona</i> or
ganglionic cells) are partially or entirely destroyed.
Here again Virchow, who was the first to make a careful
microscopic study of the finest changes in the diseased
cells, and so explain the nature of the disease, did
pioneer work. I still remember very well a spectacle
of this kind (in the summer of 1855, at Würzburg),
which made a deep impression on me. Virchow's sharp
eye had detected a small suspicious spot in the cerebrum
of a lunatic, though there seemed to be nothing remarkable
about it on superficial examination. He handed it
to me for microscopic examination, and I found that a
large number of the ganglionic cells were affected, partly
by fatty degeneration and partly by calcification. The
luminous remarks that my great teacher made on these
and similar finds in other cases of mental disorder, confirmed
my conviction of the unity of the human organism
and the inseparable connection of mind and body, which
he himself at that time expressly shared. When he
abandoned this Monistic conception of the psychic life for
Dualism and Mysticism twenty years afterwards (especially
after his Munich speech in 1877), we must attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
this partly to his psychological metamorphosis, and partly
to the political motives of which I spoke in the last
chapter.</p>

<p>We find another series of strong arguments in favour
of our Monistic psychology in the individual development
of the soul in the child and the young animal.
We know that the new-born child has as yet no consciousness,
no intelligence, no independent judgment
and thought. We follow the gradual development of
these higher faculties step by step in the first years
of life, in strict proportion to the anatomical development
of the cortex with which they are bound up. The inquiries
into the child-soul which Wilhelm Preyer began in
Jena twenty-five years ago, his careful "observations of
the mental development of man in his early years," and
the supplementary research of several more recent physiologists,
have shown, from the ontogenetic side, that the
soul is not a special immaterial entity, but the sum-total
of a number of connected functions of the brain. When
the brain dies, the soul comes to an end.</p>

<p>We have further proof in the stem-history of the soul,
which we gather from the comparative psychology of the
lower and higher mammals, and of savage and civilised
races. Modern ethnography shows us in actual
existence the various stages through which the mind
rose to its present height. The most primitive races,
such as the Veddahs of Ceylon, or the Australian
natives, are very little above the mental life of the
anthropoid apes. From the higher savages we pass by
a complete gradation of stages to the most civilised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
races. But what a gulf there is, even here, between
the genius of a Goethe, a Darwin, or a Lamarck,
and an ordinary philisthine or third-rate official. All
these facts point to one conclusion: the human soul
has only reached its present height by a long period
of gradual evolution; it differs in degree, not in kind,
from the soul of the higher mammals; and thus it
cannot in any case be immortal.</p>

<p>That a large number of educated people still cling
to the dogma of personal immortality in spite of these
luminous proofs, is owing to the great power of
conservative tradition and the evil methods of instruction
that stamp these untenable dogmas deep
on the growing mind in early years. It is for that
very reason that the Churches strive to keep the
schools under their power at any cost; they can
control and exploit the adults at will, if independent
thought and judgment have been stifled in the earlier
years.</p>

<p>This brings us to the interesting question: What
is the position of the "ecclesiastical evolution" of the
Jesuits (the "latest course of Darwinism"), as regards
this great question of the soul? Man is, according
to Wasmann, the image of God and a unique, immaterial
being, differing from all other animals in the
possession of an immortal soul, and therefore having
a totally different origin from them. Man's immortal
soul is, according to this Jesuit sophistry, "spiritual
and sensitive," while the animal soul is sensitive only.
God has implanted his own spirit in man, and associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it with an animal soul for the period of life. It is
true that Wasmann believes even man's body to have
been created directly by God; but, in view of the
overwhelming proofs of our animal descent, he leaves
open the possibility of a development from a series
of other animals, in which case the Divine spirit would
be breathed into him in the end. The Christian
Fathers, who were much occupied with the introduction
of the soul into the human embryo, tell us that the
immortal soul enters the soulless embryo on the
fortieth day after conception in the case of the boy,
and on the eightieth day in the case of the girl. If
Wasmann supposes that there was a similar introduction
of the soul in the development of the race, he must
postulate a moment in the history of the anthropoid
apes when God sent his spirit into the hitherto
unspiritual soul of the ape.</p>

<p>When we look at the matter impartially in the light
of pure reason, the belief in immortality is wholly
inconsistent with the facts of evolution and of physiology.
The ontogenetic dogma of the older Church,
that the soul is introduced into the soulless body at a
particular moment of its embryonic development, is just
as absurd as the phylogenetic dogma of the most modern
Jesuits, that the Divine spirit was breathed into the frame
of an anthropoid ape at a certain period (in the Tertiary
period), and so converted it into an immortal soul. We
may examine and test this belief as we will, we can find
in it nothing but a piece of mystic superstition. It is
maintained solely by the great power of tradition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the support of Conservative governments, the leaders
of which have no personal belief in these "revelations,"
but cling to the practical conviction that throne and
altar must support each other. They unfortunately
overlook the circumstance that the throne is apt to
become merely the footstool to the altar, and that
the Church exploits the State for its own, not the
State's, good.</p>

<p>We learn further, from the history of this dogma,
that the belief in immortality did not find its way into
science until a comparatively late date. It is not found
in the great Monistic natural philosophers who, six
centuries before the time of Christ, evinced a profound
insight into the real nature of the world. It is not
found in Democritus and Empedocles, in Seneca and
Lucretius Carus. It is not found in the older Oriental
religions, Buddhism, the ancient religion of the Chinese,
or Confucianism; in fact, there is no question of
individual persistence after death in the Pentateuch
or the earlier books of the Old Testament (which
were written before the Babylonian Exile). It was
Plato and his pupil, Aristotle, that found a place for
it in their dualistic metaphysics; and its agreement with
the Christian and Mohammedan teaching secured for it
a very widespread acceptance.</p>

<p>Another psychological dogma, the belief in man's
free-will, is equally inconsistent with the truth of evolution.
Modern physiology shows clearly that the will is
never really free in man or in the animal, but determined
by the organisation of the brain; this in turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
is determined in its individual character by the laws
of heredity and the influence of the environment. It
is only because the <em>apparent</em> freedom of the will has
such a great practical significance in the province of
religion, morality, sociology, and law, that it still forms
the subject of the most contradictory claims. Theoretically,
determinism, or the doctrine of the necessary
character of our volitions, was established long ago.</p>

<p>With the belief in the absolute freedom of the will
and the personal immortality of the soul is associated,
in the minds of many highly educated people, a third
article of faith, the belief in a personal God. It is well
known that this belief, often wrongly represented as an
indispensable foundation of religion, assumes the most
widely varied shapes. As a rule, however, it is an open
or covert anthropomorphism. God is conceived as the
"Supreme Being," but turns out, on closer examination,
to be an idealised man. According to the Mosaic
narrative, "God made man to his own image and
likeness," but it is usually the reverse; "Man made
God according to his own image and likeness." This
idealised man becomes creator and architect and produces
the world, forming the various species of plants
and animals like a modeller, governing the world like
a wise and all-powerful monarch, and, at the "Last
Judgment," rewarding the good and punishing the
wicked like a rigorous judge. The childish conceptions
of this extramundane God, who is set over against the
world as an independent being, the personal creator,
maintainer, and ruler of all things, are quite incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with the advanced science of the nineteenth century,
especially with its two greatest triumphs, the law of
substance and the law of Monistic evolution.</p>

<p>Critical philosophy, moreover, long ago pronounced
its doom. In the first place, the most famous critical
thinker, Immanuel Kant, proved in his <cite>Critique of Pure
Reason</cite> that absolute science affords no support to the
three central dogmas of metaphysics, the personal God,
the immortality of the soul, and the freedom of the
will. It is true that he afterwards (in the course of
his dualistic and dogmatic metamorphosis) taught that
we must <em>believe</em> these three great mystic forces, and
that they are indispensable postulates of practical
reason; and that the latter must take precedence
over pure reason. Modern German philosophy, which
clamours for a "return to Kant," sees his chief
distinction in this impossible reconciliation of polar
contradictions. The Churches, and the ruling powers
in alliance with them, accord a welcome to this
diametrical contradiction, recognised by all candid readers
of the Königsberg philosopher, between the two reasons.
They use the confusion that results for the purpose
of putting the light of the creeds in the darkness of
doubting reason, and imagine that they save religion
in this way.</p>

<p>Whilst we are engaged with the important subject
of religion, we must refute the charge, often made, and
renewed of recent years, that our Monistic philosophy
and the theory of evolution that forms its chief
foundation destroy religion. It is only opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
those lower forms of religion that are based on
superstition and ignorance, and would hold man's
reason in bondage by empty formalism and belief in
the miraculous, in order to control it for political
purposes. This is chiefly the case with Romanism or
Ultramontanism, that pitiful caricature of pure Christianity
that still plays so important a part in the world.
Luther would turn in his grave if he could see the
predominance of the Roman Centre party in the
German Empire to-day. We find the papacy, the
deadly enemy of Protestant Germany, controlling its
destiny, and the Reichstag submitting willingly to be
led by the Jesuits. Not a voice do we hear raised
in it against the three most dangerous and mischievous
institutions of Romanism&mdash;the obligatory celibacy of
the clergy, the confessional, and indulgences. Though
these later institutions of the Roman Church have
nothing to do with the original teaching of the Church
and pure Christianity; though their immoral consequences,
so prejudicial to the life of the family and
the State, are known to all, they exist just as they did
before the Reformation. Unfortunately, many German
princes foster the ambition of the Roman clergy, making
their "Canossa-journey" to Rome, and bending the
knee to the great charlatan at the Vatican.</p>

<p>It is also very regrettable that the increasing tendency
to external show and festive parade at what is called
"the new court" does grave injury to real and inner
religion. We have a striking instance of this external
religion in the new cathedral at Berlin, which many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
would have us regard as "Catholic," not Protestant
and Evangelical. I often met in India priests and
pilgrims who believed they were pleasing their God
by turning prayer-wheels, or setting up prayer-mills
that were set in motion by the wind. One might
utilise the modern invention of automatic machines for
the same purposes, and set up praying automata in the
new cathedral, or indulgence-machines that would give
relief from lighter sins for one mark [shilling], and from
graver sins for twenty marks. It would prove a great
source of revenue to the Church, especially if similar
machines were set up in the other churches that have
lately been erected in Berlin at a cost of millions of
marks. It would have been better to have spent the
money on schools.</p>

<p>These observations on the more repellent characters
of modern orthodoxy and piety may be taken as some
reply to the sharp attacks to which I have been exposed
for forty years, and which have lately been renewed
with great violence. The spokesmen of Catholic and
Evangelical beliefs, especially the Romanist <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Germania</cite>
and the Lutheran <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reichsbote</cite>, have vied with each other
in deploring my lectures as "a desecration of this
venerable hall," and in damning my theory of evolution&mdash;without,
of course, making any attempt to repute its
scientific truth. They have, in their Christian charity,
thought fit to put sandwich-men at the doors of this
room, to distribute scurrilous attacks on my person and
my teaching to those who enter. They have made a
generous use of the fanatical calumnies that the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
chaplain, Stöcker, the theologian, Loofs, the philologist,
Dennert, and other opponents of my <cite>Riddle of the
Universe</cite>, have disseminated, and to which I make a
brief reply at the end of that work. I pass by
the many untruths of these zealous protagonists of
theology. We men of science have a different conception
of truth from that which prevails in ecclesiastical
circles.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>As regards the relation of science to Christianity, I will
only point out that it is quite irreconcilable with the
mystic and supernatural Christian beliefs, but that it
fully recognises the high ethical value of Christian
morality. It is true that the highest commands of the
Christian religion, especially those of sympathy and
brotherly love, are not discoveries of its own; the
golden rule was taught and practised centuries before
the time of Christ. However, Christianity has the distinction
of preaching and developing it with a fresh force.
In its time it has had a beneficial influence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
development of civilisation, though in the Middle Ages
the Roman Church became, with its Inquisition, its
witch-drowning, its burning of heretics, and its religious
wars, the bloodiest caricature of the gentle religion of
love. Orthodox <em>historical</em> Christianity is not directly
destroyed by modern science, but by its own learned and
zealous theologians. The enlightened Protestantism that
was so effectively advocated by Schleiermacher in Berlin
eighty years ago, the later works of Feuerbach, the
inquiries into the life of Jesus of David Strauss and
Ernest Renan, the lectures recently delivered here by
Delitzsch and Harnack, have left very little of what
strict orthodoxy regards as the indispensable foundations
of historical Christianity. Kalthoff, of Bremen, goes so
far as to declare that all Christian traditions are myths,
and that the development of Christianity is a necessary
outcome of the civilisation of the time.</p>

<p>In view of this broadening tendency in theology and
philosophy at the beginning of the twentieth century,
it is an unfortunate anachronism that the Ministers of
Public Instruction of Prussia and Bavaria sail in the
wake of the Catholic Church, and seek to instil the spirit
of the Jesuits in both lower and higher education. It is
only a few weeks since the Prussian Minister of Worship
made a dangerous attempt to suppress academic
freedom, the palladium of mental life in Germany.
This increasing reaction recalls the sad days of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when thousands
of the finest citizens of Germany migrated to North
America, in order to develop their mental powers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a free atmosphere. This selective process formed a
blessing to the United States, but it was certainly
very injurious to Germany. Large numbers of weak
and servile characters and sycophants were thus
favoured. The fossilised ideas of many of our leading
jurists seem to take us back sometimes to the Cretaceous
and Jurassic periods, while the palæozoic rhetoric of
our theologians and synods even goes back to the
Permian and Carboniferous epochs.</p>

<p>However, we must not take too seriously the
anxiety that this increasing political and clerical
reaction causes us. We must remember the vast
resources of civilisation that are seen to-day in our
enormous international intercourse, and must have
confidence in the helpful exchange of ideas between
east and west that is being effected daily by our
means of transit. Even in Germany the darkness
that now prevails will at length give place to the
dazzling light of the sun. Nothing, in my opinion,
will contribute more to that end than the unconditional
victory of the idea of evolution.</p>

<p>Beside the law of evolution, and closely connected
with it, we have that great triumph of modern science,
the law of substance&mdash;the law of the conservation of
matter (Lavoisier, 1789), and of the conservation of
energy (Robert Mayer, 1842). These two laws are
irreconcilable with the three central dogmas of
metaphysics, which so many educated people still
regard as the most precious treasures of their
spiritual life&mdash;the belief in a personal God, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
personal immortality of the soul, and the liberty of
the human will. But these great objects of belief,
so intimately bound up with numbers of our treasured
achievements and institutions, are not on that account
driven out of the world. They merely cease to pose
as truths in the realm of pure science. As imaginative
creations, they retain a certain value in the world of
poetry. Here they will not only, as they have done
hitherto, furnish thousands of the finest and most lofty
motives for every branch of art&mdash;sculpture, painting,
or music&mdash;but they will still have a high ethical and
social value in the education of the young and in
the organisation of society. Just as we derive artistic
and ethical inspiration from the legends of classical
antiquity (such as the Hercules myth, the <cite>Odyssey</cite>
and the <cite>Iliad</cite>) and the story of William Tell, so we
will continue to do in regard to the stories of the
Christian mythology. But we must do the same with
the poetical conceptions of other religions, which have
given the most varied forms to the transcendental
ideas of God, freedom, and immortality.</p>

<p>Thus the noble warmth of art will remain, together
with&mdash;not in opposition to, but in harmony with&mdash;the
splendid light of science, one of the most precious
possessions of the human mind. As Goethe said: "He
who has science and art has religion; he who has not
these two had better have religion." Our Monistic
system, the "connecting link between religion and
science," brings God and the world into unity in the
sense that Goethe willed, the sense that Spinoza clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
expressed long ago and Giordano Bruno had sealed with
his martyrdom. It has been said repeatedly of late that
Goethe was an orthodox Christian. A few years ago a
young orator quoted him in support of the wonderful
dogmas of the Christian religion. We may point out
that Goethe himself expressly said he was "a decided
non-Christian." The "great heathen of Weimar" has
given the clearest expression to his Pantheistic views
in his noblest poems, <cite>Faust</cite>, <cite>Prometheus</cite>, and <cite>God and
the World</cite>. How could so vigorous a thinker, in whose
mind the evolution of organic life ran through millions
of years, have shared the narrow belief of a Jewish
prophet and enthusiast who sought to give up his life
for humanity 1,900 years ago?</p>

<p>Our Monistic god, the all-embracing essence of the
world, the Nature-god of Spinoza and Goethe, is
identical with the eternal, all-inspiring energy, and is one,
in eternal and infinite substance, with space-filling matter.
It "lives and moves in all things," as the Gospel says.
And as we see that the law of substance is universal,
that the conservation of matter and of energy is inseparably
connected, and that the ceaseless development of this
substance follows the same "eternal iron laws," we find
God in natural law itself. The will of God is at work
in every falling drop of rain and every growing crystal,
in the scent of the rose and the spirit of man.</p>

<p class="noindent">The enormous length of the biogenetic periods (<em>i.e.</em>, the periods
during which organic life has been evolving on our planet) is still
very differently estimated by geologists and paleontologists, astronomers
and physicists, because the empirical data of the calculation are very
incomplete and admit great differences of estimate. However, most
modern experts aver that their length runs to 100 and 200 million
years (some say double this, and even more). If we take the lesser
figure of 100 millions, we find this distributed over the five chief
periods of organic geology very much as is shown on Table 1.
In order to get a clearer idea of the vast duration of these
evolutionary periods, and to appreciate the relative shortness of
the "historical period," Dr. H. Schmidt (Jena) has reduced the
100,000,000 years to a day. In this scheme the twenty-four hours of
"creation-day" are distributed as follows over the five evolutionary
periods:</p>

<p class="p2 pfs80">EVOLUTION AND JESUITISM</p>


<p class="p1 noindent">The relation of the theory of evolution to the teaching
of the Jesuits is in many respects so important and so
liable to misunderstanding that I have felt it very
desirable to make it clear in the present work. I have,
I think, clearly showed that the two doctrines are
diametrically and irreconcilably opposed, and that the
attempt of the modern Jesuits to reconcile the two
antagonists is mere sophistry. I wrote with special
reference to the works of the learned Jesuit, Father
Erich Wasmann, not only because that writer deals with
the subject more ably and comprehensively than most of
his colleagues, but because he is more competent to
make a scientific defence of his views on account of
his long studies of the ants and his general knowledge
of biology. He has made a vigorous reply to my
strictures in an "open letter" to me, which appeared
on 2nd May, 1905, in the Berlin (or Roman) <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Germania</cite>,
and in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kölnische Volkszeitung</cite>.</p>

<p>The sophistical objections that Wasmann raises to my
lectures, and his misleading statement of the most important
problems, oblige me to make a brief reply in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"Postscript." It will be impossible, of course, to meet
all his points here, and convince him of their futility.
Not even the clearest and most rigorous logic makes a
man a match for a Jesuit; he adroitly employs the facts
themselves for the purpose of concealing the truth by
his perverse misstatements. It is vain to hope to
convince my opponent by rational argument, when he
believes that religious faith is "higher than all reason."
A good idea can be formed of his position from the
conclusion of the eleventh chapter of his work, <cite>Modern
Biology and the Theory of Evolution</cite> (p. 307). "There can
never be a real contradiction between natural knowledge
and supernatural revelation, because both have their
origin in the same Divine spirit." This is a fine comment
on the incessant struggle that "natural science" is
compelled to maintain against "supernatural revelation,"
and that fills the whole philosophical and theological
literature of the last half century.</p>

<p>Wasmann's orthodox position is shown most clearly
by the following statement: "The theory of evolution,
to which I subscribe as a scientist and a philosopher,
rests on the foundations of the Christian doctrine which
I hold to be the only true one: 'In the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth.'" Unfortunately,
he does not tell us how he conceives this
"creation out of nothing," and what he means by
"God" and "heavens." I would recommend him to
consult Troelslund's excellent work, <cite>The Idea of Heaven
and of the World</cite>.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time that I was delivering my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
lectures at Berlin, Wasmann was giving a series of
thoroughly Jesuitical lectures on the subject at Lucerne.
The Catholic Lucerne journal, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterland</cite>, describes these
lectures as "a work of emancipation" and "a critical
moment in the intellectual struggle." It quotes the
following sentence: "At the highest stage of the
theistic philosophy of evolution is God, the omnipotent
creator of heaven and earth; next to him, created by
him, is the immortal soul of man. We reach this
conclusion, not only by faith, but by inductive and
strictly scientific methods. The system that is reared
on the theistic doctrine of evolution is the sole rational
and truly scientific system; the atheistic position is
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'irrational and inscientific'">irrational and unscientific</ins>."</p>

<p>In order to see the untruth of this and the succeeding
statements of the modern Jesuits, we have to remember
that the Churches&mdash;both Protestant and Catholic&mdash;have
vigorously combated the theory of evolution with all
their power for thirty years, ever since the first appearance
of Darwinism. The shrewd clergy saw more
clearly than many of our naïve philosophers that
Darwin's theory of descent is the inevitable key-stone
of the whole theory of evolution, and that "the descent
of man from other mammals" is a rigorous deduction
from it. As Karl Escherich well says: "Hitherto we
read in the faces of our clerical opponents only hatred,
bitterness, contempt, mockery, or pity in regard to the
new invader of their dogmatic structure, the idea of
evolution. Now (since Wasmann's apostasy) the assurances
of the Catholic journals, that the Church has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
admitted the theory of evolution for decades, make us
smile. Evolution has now pressed on to its final victory,
and these people would have us believe that they were
never unfriendly to it, never shrieked and stormed
against it. How, they say, could anyone have been so
foolish, when the theory of evolution puts the wisdom
and power of the creator in a nobler light than ever."
We find a similar diplomatic retreat in the popular work
of the Jesuit, Father Martin Gander, <cite>The Theory of
Descent</cite> (1904): "Thus the modern forms of matter were
not immediately created by God; they are effects of the
formative forces, which were put by the creator in the
primitive matter, and gradually came into view in the
course of the earth's history, when the external conditions
were given in the proper combination." That
is a remarkable change of front on the part of the
clergy.</p>

<p>We see the astonishing system of the Jesuits, and of
the papacy of which they are the bodyguard, not only
in this impossible jumble of evolution and theology, but
also in other passages of Wasmann, Gander, Gutberlet,
and their colleagues. The serious dangers that threaten
our schools, and the whole of our higher culture, from
this Jesuitical sham-science, have been well pointed out
lately by Count von Hoensbroech in the preface to his
famous work, <cite>The Papacy in its Social and Intellectual
Activity</cite> (1901). "The papacy," he says, "in its claim
to a Divine authority, transmitted to it by Christ,
endowed with infallibility in all questions of faith and
morals, is the greatest, the most fatal, the most successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
error in the whole of history. This great error is
girt about by the thousands of lies of its supporters;
this error and these lies work for a system of power and
domination, for ultramontanism. The truth can but
struggle against it.... Nowhere do we find so much
and such systematic lying as in Catholic science, and in
the history of the Church and the papacy; nowhere are
the lies and misrepresentations more pernicious than
here; they have become part and parcel of the Catholic
religion. The facts of history tell plainly enough that
the papacy is anything but a Divine institution; that it
has brought more curses and ruin, more bloody turmoil
and profanation, into humanity's holiest of holies, religion,
than any other power in the world."</p>

<p>This severe judgment on the papacy and Jesuitism
is the more valuable as Count von Hoensbroech was
himself in the service of the Jesuit Congregation for
forty years, and learned thoroughly all its tricks and
intrigues. In making them public, and basing his
charges on numerous official documents, he has done
great service to the cause of truth and civilisation. I
was merely repeating his well-founded verdict when,
at the close of my first lecture, I described the
papacy as the greatest swindle the world has ever
submitted to.</p>

<p>A curious irony of Fate gave me an opportunity,
the same evening, to experience in my own person
the correctness of this verdict. A Berlin reporter
telegraphed to London that I had fully accepted the
new theory of Father Wasmann, and recognised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
error of Darwinism; that the theory of evolution is
not applicable to man on account of his mental
superiority. This welcome intelligence passed from
London to America and many other countries. The
result was a flood of letters from zealous adherents of
the theory of evolution, interrogating me as to my
unintelligible change of front. I thought at first that
the telegram was due to the misunderstanding or the
error of a reporter, but I was afterwards informed
from Berlin that the false message was probably due
to a deliberate corruption by some religious person
who thought to render a service to his faith by this
untruth. He had substituted "supported" for
"refuted," and "error" for "truth."</p>

<p>The struggle for the triumph of truth, in which I
have had the most curious experiences during the last
forty years, has brought me a number of new
impressions through my Berlin lectures. The flood
of calumnies of all kinds that the religious press
(especially the Lutheran <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reichsbote</cite> and the Catholic
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Germania</cite>) poured over me exceeded any that had
gone before. Dr. Schmidt gave a selection from
them in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freie Wort</cite> (No. 4, p. 144). I have
already pointed out, in the Appendix to the popular
edition of the <cite>Riddle of the Universe</cite> [German edition],
what unworthy means are employed by my clerical
and metaphysical opponents for the purpose of
bringing my popular scientific works into disrepute. I
can only repeat here that the calumniation of my
person does not move me, and does not injure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cause of truth which I serve. It is just this unusually
loud alarm of my clerical enemies that tells me my
sacrifices have not been in vain, and that I have put
the modest key-stone to the work of my life&mdash;"The
advancement of knowledge by the spread of the idea
of evolution."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The word "evolution" is still used in so many different ways in
various sciences that it is important to fix it in the general significance
which we here give it. By "evolution," in the widest sense, I understand
the unceasing "mutations of substance," adopting Spinoza's
fundamental conception of substance; it unites inseparably in itself
"matter and force (or energy)," or "nature and mind" (= the world
and God). Hence the science of evolution in its broader range is
"the history of substance," which postulates the general validity of
"the law of substance." In the latter are combined "the law of the
constancy of matter" (Lavoisier, 1789) and "the law of the conservation
of energy" (Robert Mayer, 1842), however varied may be the
changes of <em>form</em> of these elements in the world-process. <em>Cf.</em> Chapter
XII. of <cite>The Riddle</cite>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Certain orthodox periodicals have lately endeavoured to deny this
famous atheistical confession of the great Laplace, which was merely a
candid deduction of his splendid cosmic system. They say that this
Monistic natural philosopher acknowledged the Catholic faith on his
death-bed; and in proof of this they offer us the later testimony of an
Ultramontane priest. We need not point out how uncertain is the
love of truth of these heated partisans. When testimony of this kind
tends to "the good of religion" (<em>i.e.</em>, their own good), it is held to be
a pious work (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pia fraus</i>). On the other hand, it is interesting to recall
the reply of a Prussian Minister of Religion, Von Zedlitz, 120 years
ago, to the Breslau Consistory, when it urged that "those who believe
most are the best subjects." He wrote in reply: "His majesty
[Frederick the Great] is not disposed to rest the security of his State
on the stupidity of his subjects."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> See, for instance, <cite>Moses and Geology, or Harmony of the Bible with
Science</cite>, by Samuel Kinns (1882). In this work the pious Biblical
astronomer executes the most incredible and Jesuitical manœuvres in
order to bring about an impossible reconciliation between science and
the Biblical narrative.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The eel-like sophistry of the Jesuits, which has been brought to such
a wonderful pitch in their political system, cannot, as a rule, be met by
argument. An interesting illustration of this was given by Father
Wasmann himself in his controversy with the physician, Dr. Julian
Marcuse. The "scientific" Wasmann had gone so far in his zeal for
religion as to support a downright swindle of a "miraculous cure" in
honour of the "Mother of God of Oostacker" (the Belgian Lourdes).
Dr. Marcuse succeeded in exposing the whole astounding story of this
"pious fraud" (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Stimmen</cite>, Berlin, 1903, iv. Jahrg., No. 20).
Instead of giving a scientific refutation, the Jesuit replied with sophistic
perversion and personal invective (Scientific [?] Supplement to
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Germania</cite>, Berlin, 1902, No. 43, and 1903, No. 13). In his final
reply, Dr. Marcuse said: "I have accomplished my object&mdash;to let
thoughtful people see once more the kind of ideas that are found in the
world of dead and literal faith, which tries to put the crudest superstition
and reverence for the myth of miraculous cures in the place of science,
truth and knowledge" (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Stimmen</cite>, 1903, v. Jahrgang, No. 3).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> While these pages are in the press the journals announce a fresh
humiliation of the German empire that will cause great grief. On the
9th of May the nation celebrated the centenary of the death of
Friedrich Schiller. With rare unanimity all the political parties of
Germany, and all the German associations abroad, came together to do
honour to the great poet of German idealism. Professor Theobald
Ziegler delivered a very fine address at Strassburg University. The
Emperor, who happened to be in the town, was invited, but did not
attend; instead of doing so, he held a military parade in the vicinity.
A few days afterwards he sat at table with the German Catholic
cardinals and bishops, amongst them being the fanatical Bishop
Benzler, who declared that a Christian cemetery was desecrated by
the interment of a Protestant. At these festive dinners German
Catholics always give the first toast to the Pope, the second to the
Emperor; they rejoice at present that the Emperor and Pope are <em>allies</em>.
But the whole history of the papacy (a pitiful caricature of the ancient
Catholic faith) shows clearly that they are natural and irreconcilable
enemies. Either emperor must rule <em>or</em> pope.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> I may remind those who think that the hall of the Musical Academy
is "desecrated" by my lectures, that it was in the very same place that
Alexander von Humboldt delivered, seventy-seven years ago (1828), the
remarkable lectures that afterwards made up his <cite>Cosmos</cite>. The great
traveller, whose clear mind had recognised the unity of Nature, and had,
with Goethe, discovered therein the real knowledge of God, endeavoured
to convey his thoughts in popular form to the educated Berlin public,
and to establish the universality of natural law. It was my aim to
establish, as regards the organic world, precisely what Humboldt had
proved to exist in inorganic nature. I wanted to show how the great
advance of modern biology (since Darwin's time) enables us to solve
the most difficult of all problems, the historical development of plants
and animals in humanity. Humboldt in his day earned the most lively
approval and gratitude of all free-thinking and truth-seeking men, and
the displeasure and suspicion of the orthodox and conservative courtiers
at Berlin.</p></div></div>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
